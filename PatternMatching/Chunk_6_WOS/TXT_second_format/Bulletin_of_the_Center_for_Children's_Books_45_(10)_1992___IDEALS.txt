Gr. 5-. 
The strength of this book lies in its section of
descriptions and illustrations that teach how to tie several nautical knots.
Although the pencil and ink drawings are sometimes too crowded for complete
clarity, it is possible to learn the knots from this section if one is practicing
with a piece of string. Otherwise, the disorganized text includes advice for tying
plywood to the roof of a car, sewing on a button, and tying a tie. Some of the
large-scale drawings (like that of the car) are so busy it can be difficult to locate
the letters that match the step-by-step explanations within the text. Although
there are sufficient definitions for knot-tying terms, plenty of mysterious words
are used that are never defined, as in the phrase "hoist the topside mate using the
main or jib halyard with a winch." Adkins' whimsical writing style is both
amusing and distracting, as in the description of the bowline knot as "the
Abraham Lincoln of knots--common, useful, strong, deceptively subtle, and
elegant in its simplicity." While intermittently useful--especially for young
sailors-the problems of this book are too many to untangle. KJ

Maggie, almost thirteen, has come to spend a month
with her father and his young second wife, Joanna, in a rented lakeside cottage in
Massachusetts. There's a new baby, about whom Maggie is curious but
ambivalent; Joanna is insistently but persuasively friendly. The problem is Dad.
Preoccupied with work, moody, oblivious to the baby, and nasty to Joanna, he
insists that Maggie have a good time but does little to ensure it. Maggie finds
refuge in quietly, minutely observing a blue heron that lives in a nearby swamp;
to her dismay, she also finds evidence that someone plans to kill it. The
conflicts are tense and intense and prevent the basically interiorized story from
becoming static. As in Paula Fox's The Moonlight Man, the father here shows
[253 ]
traces of real love for his daughter that make his eventual betrayal all the more
convincing and disturbing. A man with a few sad secrets, he is viewed through
the insistent lense of Maggie's perceptions. Joanna is a complicated, though
always sympathetic, character; Maggie is lucky to have her, a fortune not
extended to Maggie's father, who, it may be, loses both women in the end.
Honest and understated, this is a fine complement to Avi's adventure stories, and
an equally fine compliment to his craft. RS

Color photographs add to the appeal of a book that

For fifteen years, Jacques d'Amboise and his National
Dance Institute have worked with kids in New York public schools, giving dance
classes throughout the year and building up to the Event of the Year, the
performance where all the students (and adult dancers as needed) join together.
This photo-essay follows d'Amboise through a year, starting with the selection
of student dancers (the text always calls them "dancers," never "kids") not on the
basis of their previous experience but their "desire to sweat like a professional."
The text then follows, month by month, preparation for the performance of
Chakra: A Celebration of India; as both regular dancers and the particularly
talented "SWAT team" ("It's like the police have specialists, we have
specialists," says d'Amboise) rehearse, d'Amboise takes a research trip to India,
and scenery and costumes begin to take shape. The pictures contain as much
action as still photographs can: Jacques and the dancers with open mouths and
flying feet, or the SWAT team with intense absorption on every young face.
The design is distracting, however, with photos backgrounded by angled colored
shapes (that emphasize the unevenness of the lighting in some pictures), and
little color cutouts dribbling across the white space; the typeface is artistic at the
expense of readability. The actual performance photographs are impressively
displayed, with pictures and white text on black pages recreating the dark of the
theater to dramatic effect. D'Amboise's warmth and vitality come across more
vividly in the Oscar-winning documentary He Makes Me Feel Like Dancing, but
this is a good print chronicle of an unusual program, and one that succeeds in
[ 254 ]
conveying the pleasure of shared experience in a big production. A note on the
history of the National Dance Institute is included. DS

With commendable patience and optimism, Bauer
undertakes the nearly impossible task of dissecting the essentially intuitive
writing process into planning a story, developing characters, focusing a point of
view, generating dialogue, enhancing story tension, and working through
revisions. Her concepts are clearly stated, but her examples suffer from a random
range; one short story given in full and drawn on throughout the book would
have been more effective than frequently improvised scenarios or brief references
to her own and others' books. However, the tone is accessible and the seasoned
advice valuable, especially in relating succinct precepts to the child's level of
experience: "I think of my main character's problem as a rope stretching from
the beginning of the story to the end. I never drop the rope, nor do I hang things
from it like a clothesline. Rather, I try to weave every part of the story in with
it." Bauer is also honest about both problems ("You probably can't get it
published anywhere") and possibilities ("There are many reasons for writing that
have nothing to do with being published"). BH

Eleven-year-old Emma finally wrests from her parents
the pony they had promised her, and the result is nothing but disaster. She's too
young and undisciplined to handle Freckles, a lively and stubborn pony, and after
several disasters Freckles is returned to his original owner. Freckles then ends
up in the hands of a riding stable where he is treated cruelly, and a pining Emma
and her friends steal and hide him, hoping eventually to buy him back.
Although the writing is smooth, there's not much characterization; the evil
people, especially the riding-stable owner, are melodramatic villains, with the
stable being a Dickensian place seemingly designed expressly for punishment of
unloved children and animals. 
There's an appealing realism, however, in
Emma's desperate obsession with the well-being of all animals, including the
pony for which she's obviously not ready (and that's a nicely original touch in a
horse story). Kids may be confused by abrupt Americanizations in an obviously
British book (amid gymkhanas, Pony Clubbing, and hedgerows, mentions of
dollars and the American Horse Show Association sound odd), but they will love
the melodrama and the animal saga. DS

Rigorously documented, this is a sobering overview
of the lives of New York City children who are homeless, and staying in squalid
hotels, huge city barracks-style shelters, or-rarely-in small shelters run by
[255 ]
private nonprofit agencies. Chapters cover the economic climate that leads to
homelessness, the kinds of shelter available, the impediments to health and
education posed by homelessness, and the psychological burdens placed on
children who don't have their own places to live. Throughout, the dismal facts
are given witness by the stories of homeless children themselves, recorded by
Berck, who interviewed more than thirty young people, mostly adolescents,
living in hotels or shelters. These kids speak of drug dealing in the hallways,
the social stigma of homelessness, the need to care for parents who have given
up hope. Helped by a selection of black-and-white photographs, the book's
balance between information and anecdote is excellent, avoiding both fact-
packing and sentimentality. "You have to really be there to understand it," says
twelve-year-old Shama, but these stories and statistics go a good deal of the

Bingo's affection for Melissa has not cooled, but he
has tired of the interrogative mode and has decided instead to give advice in the
form of a Guide to Romance, A Record of the Personal Ups and Downs of Bingo
Brown. Dedicated to My Brother, Jamie, as a Guide and Comfort to Him When
He Finds Himself, as He Surely Will, upon the Roller Coaster of Life. As a
narrative device, this is not quite as binding as Bingo's burning questions
(BCCB 4/88), and the plot is certainly less probing. On the light side, however,
Byars is consistently funny in tone and dialogue: "Fine! Great!" says Bingo's
angry mother. "Her nostrils were so flared now that Bingo thought he caught
sight of her brain. 'Then go to your room for the rest of your life.'" The
agonies of adolescence, too, have a naturalistic ring, as in Melissa's appearing
"bigger than life" when she returns to town after a significant growth spurt, or
Bingo's spying on her as she picks out "Health Supplies" in the grocery store.
Bingo's baby brother is the focus of some of the best lines ("You need teeth,
because teeth dam up the drool") and action ("Jamie did not know spaghetti was
to be eaten. He thought you slapped at it in a violent way and, later, when tired
of the violence, swept it off the tray onto the floor"). More episodic than
cohesive, this is nevertheless keen-eyed and better-written than most series titles.

turns out to be the Cat, who stole them for the Troll to use as a pair of ear-
warmers. A slight tale in any case, it is here overwhelmed by Christiana's
paintings; large double spreads that juxtapose little Buttercup and big menaces
such as the leaping cat and the gloomy troll. Lacking a story to support, the
paintings exist mainly to call attention to themselves, inviting a scrutiny that
reveals technical bravura (Buttercup perched on the brow of Owl, for example)

Although the writing has a plain and occasionally
choppy quality, this honest account is one of the few children's books that
presents a non-Jewish German child's view of the war (see Christine
Nostlinger's Fly Away Home, BCCB 2/76, and T. Degens' Transport 7-41-R,
BCCB 3/75, for noteworthy fictional exceptions). In fact, the author makes no
mention of anti-Semitism at all, either because she was unaware of it or because
she was protected, in her natural state of childhood self-absorption, by the adults
around her-as she was in the case of her grandfather's repeated arrests for anti-
Nazi activities. What she did suffer, even more than rationing or bombing, was
the loss of her father, who died at the Russian front after serving in France and
other combat areas. The chronological organization is not always clear-cut, but
frequent section headings help orient browsers, who will also appreciate the
abundant black-and-white photographs of family and wartime scenes. What
commends this book are clearly remembered details of drudgery as well as drama
during a time when even the relatively privileged died or survived by luck alone
(a neighbor describes a couple's fate next door to the author's house after an
Allied raid: "Rose is decapitated and Albert's stomach is all out. My Daddy
found them"). It becomes increasingly clear here that whatever their parents'

Chapter by chapter Facklam discusses the
domestication of various animals, from the expectable dogs and horses through
[ 258 ]
the more surprising silkworms and camels. In chatty, accessible language she
outlines the importance (or, in one chapter, past importance) of these creatures as
companions, beasts of burden, food, etc. She includes both animals selectively
bred by humans (the traditional definition of domestication) and those merely
used by them, which makes the definition of domestication somewhat confusing.
Although she mentions animal rights concerns, they're not explored deeply or
consistently; the detailed description of battery hen farming, for instance, really
needs a mention of the ethical questions involved. However, the book provides a
useful overview of the way our species has adapted animals, including those that
young readers may not have considered (such as ostriches and elephants), for use
in our daily lives. 
Appearing throughout the text are black-and-white
illustrations, frequently stiffly drawn and occasionally incorrect: in the horse
section, for instance, the animal labeled "Appaloosa" isn't-it's a pinto, and the
pair identified as Clydesdales look more like Belgians. DS

waited for Jazz and Koo in the driveway." Thus begins a visit alternating
between the twins' wealthy grandfather, on one side of the family, and their
homespun grandmother, on the other side-and never the twain shall meet. The
plot is not short on incident, but the only thematic focus is the adults'
bickering, which becomes overused to the point of contrivance in holding
together disparate episodes. If the old people's enmity becomes predictable,
however, the ending is not: creditably, they don't make up, but sound ready to
launch into disagreements of more frenetic proportions when the children's
parents arrive home from Europe, "And Just in Time." Pearson's black-and-
white drawings make light of selected scenes such as the children's dinner at a
ritzy club, their delivery of food to a homeless person, their call on a judge who
raises chickens in his house, an illness, an accident, and an ill-fated excursion.

When Griffin's story of Liza and her older sister Kay

that they have assumed new identities. What is hinted (broadly) is that Kay has
been abused by their stepfather but hasn't explained this to the little sister she is
protecting by removing her from danger. They camp out in an abandoned house
after riding a bus to a small town, and here they start a new life, Kay finding a
job and Liza staying home and learning how to keep house. What shouldn't
work, structurally, but does, is a fantasy element: Hobkin is a fairy who had
come over from England with an early settler, and (usually invisible) he turns a
helping hand, often saving Liza from domestic disaster, and at times from real
danger. Kay is impatient with Liza's reports of Hobkin, but most of the local
people simply take his existence for granted. Occasionally, he's been seen; at
the close of the story Kay sees him too. The author has made the two facets of
the book credible, but it's the seamless blending that is impressive; the people
and the plot are effectively interactive in this inventive tale. ZS

while preparing a parental surprise (no-bake cookies), then she feels lonely, and
finally her nervousness turns to terror when she hears a strange noise. By the
time Mom and Dad get back, Amy feels she's been a failure at being
independent. Her parents point out that she's been brave, that she obeyed all the
safety rules, and that her cookies are delicious. Illustrated with inviting ink
drawings and simply told, this has enough action to hold a reader's interest, and
the situation has a universal appeal. ZS

Based on primary source material, this is historical
fiction that has chapter/episodes rather than a continuous narrative structure. The
time is 1834, the place is Indianapolis, and the protagonist is nine-year-old
Elijah Fletcher (whose unpublished manuscript provides many of the incidents
for the book). Elijah changes schools, has minor adventures with his brother
Cooley, visits Cincinnati, and goes to a county fair, among other activities.
The writing is smooth but rather flat, the characterization minimal, and the
inclusion of historical information at times obtrusive; period details are,
however, convincing. ZS

Max and his pals, Gordy and Austin Healy, try to
break into the TV commercial biz. Although Max gets annoyed with his sister
Rosalie's suggestions for his audition, as Austin's manager, Max follows
Rosalie's model in coaching Austin. Max's chutzpah in becoming a manager
provides the humor, and Max's unsolicited advice to Austin provides the
conflict, but the writing is sometimes choppy and the action overexplained.
While not as funny and fresh as Herman's other stories about Max (Max Malone

No nightgowns allowed. Jenny said it wasn't fair about the

At the conclusion to The Street Dancers (BCCB

not her own. An audition for a Broadway show, however, is apparently much
more pleasant than one for a soap opera, and in this sequel, Fitzi joins her
grandfather and parents by landing a part in the huge new musical in town. She
loves her modest chorus role with its solo dance, and she's pretty fond of Mark,
the handsome teenage lead. As understudy, Fitzi learns the star's role, but she's
not worried about having to play it-not with competitive Tiffany in the part.
When Tiffany inevitably disappears, the story takes on a darker tone during the
police investigation, but the show goes on. 
Many of the show business

In her first book for children, artist Jenkins presents
such concepts as individual (and differing) reactions to colors, the use of colors
in language (seeing red, feeling blue) and the range of hues for each color. To a
limited extent, she succeeds, since a line of color-daubs (for example, rose red,
flame red, strawberry red, crimson red, scarlet red, etc.) atop each spread affirms
the existence of variations. Unfortunately, either the labelling or the color
registration has led to some odd results (the so-called "royal blue" is actually
purple), and the use of invented distinctions ("bruise blue," "lobster pink,"
"booger green") may add to the confusion. Still, the combination of visually
attractive colors and the message closing the double-page spread on black ("I am
black and Simon is white. But we're all the same inside") make the book
appealing. ZS

Promotional copy accompanying the galley claims
for the book an affinity with Stephen King and V. C. Andrews ("in language and
detail appropriate for young adults"-somebody at Walker needs to get out more
often): while the Andrews analogy doesn't hold, there are certainly ties with
King's books, particularly The Shining. And, at least for the first third,
Kelleher's book rivals, even betters, much adult pulp horror for sheer scariness.
Del-Del is the bleak and creepy persona assumed by seven-year-old Sam on the
occasion of the anniversary of his sister Laura's death. Sam's grandmother
believes he is possessed by the devil, and a kind of exorcism seems to turn the
trick, but the second third of the book reveals that Del-Del, apparently
unexorcised, is actually an alien refugee from a distant planet. It seems a bit
lame, but as the last third shows, rightly so, as Kelleher reveals that both
manifestations of Del-Del were the desperate psychotic attempts of a gifted little
boy to hide from the reality of his sister's death. The story is told by Sam's
other sister Beth, and the family tensions are fraught and well-wrought. Surely
paced and pretty spooky, Kelleher's book even has an advantage over King's and
Andrews' sagas: it's shorter. RS

bouncing baby, lighter than air, whom the family names Sammy (alas, it's a

charming, ballast is added by Allie's grumpiness, and by her father's tart
bemusement: "We are not keeping this-this-little chunk of matter that fell

fascination with the Star Baby overwhelms their appreciation of Allie's birthday

While the title is a play on soaps, this book is a
suds-free realistic fantasy, distant kin to Freaky Friday. Garet writes the story as
an assigned autobiography for her seventh-grade English class, but although her
teacher may believe that her "troubles began in July, when I got my twin sister,
Daisy," no one will believe that Daisy appeared suddenly out of nowhere. Daisy
actually came down the laundry chute, whose slogan exhorts "Be fifty years
ahead of your time"-which is what Daisy is. In fact, the maddeningly prissy
and manipulative Daisy seems to be Garet's grandmother at the age of twelve,
which makes things rather awkward since Garet's sole surviving relative, with
whom she lives, is the same grandmother at sixty-two; as if that revelation
weren't enough, it becomes clear that Garet herself is another version of her
"grandmother," who had been pushed down the laundry chute at the age of two.
This takes a different slant than time travel stories usually do: the girls aren't
supposed to go back to the old time. The humor is astringent and domestic, and
there's an offhand championing of environment and self-determination over
heredity that justifies the differences between the three "versions" of the same
person. 
The school-assignment framework is a bit mannered, but the
relationship between Garet and the enigmatic Daisy makes the book readable to
the light-hearted end; throughout, it's a funny and interestingly offbeat story.

the million fish that Hugh catches, and the fate of all but three, they'll be all the
wiser to yarns and how to spin them. The play between fantasy and reality is
neatly handled, with action following exaggeration in an ambiguous way that
leaves the ending open as to who's telling the truth and who believes what. The
African-American characters and swamp setting swirl across the pages in thick,
rounded strokes of brazen-hued paint, well-matched with the story's brassy flash.

Illustrator Brusca gives the Old West a historically
appropriate multicultural tilt here, picturing the cowboys as a mixed bag of
whites, Hispanics, and African Americans. The "educated greenhorn" who tames
the fabled Zebra Dun is black; the horse itself is striped and bronzy-yellow.
Medearis's adaptation of the cowboy lyric is sometimes thumpy but has a
Western twang, and the music is provided on the endpapers (although you might
have some trouble matching all the syllables to the given notes). The tone is
broad but pointed by Brusca's watercolor illustrations, which are spiky and
kinetic, colored with an unlikely light that adds to the fabulated flavor. A
historical note is appended, and while the adaptor states that she found the song
in a "book of cowboy songs," she doesn't supply the title. RS

The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse have
nothing on Dale, on the farm, and Leda, in the city. "They really hate each
other." These two kids envy just about everything about each other, so they
meet one day for a fight. "Leda goes first. OAF." The battle revs up quickly
("DIMWIT, KLUTZ"), with Small's shifting, delightfully surreal landscapes
providing the fighting ground, as well as grounding for the metaphors.
Shoulder-deep in a river, for example, the two exchange appropriately aquatic
epithets: "Dale flounders. FLUKE. Leda fishes around for a retort. SMELT."
And in the end the two, exhausted, shake hands and agree to "meet halfway again
soon." The elegantly lined watercolors are a crisp complement to this wacky

With his family recently emigrated from Shanghai to
Seattle, Yang's father thinks his children could be (should be) a first-class string
quartet. While Eldest Brother (first violin), Second Sister (viola), and Third
Sister ('cello) love music, Yingtao, the youngest, is tone deaf and his playing of
the second violin part clearly demonstrates the fact. Too bad his father doesn't
approve of baseball-that's where Yingtao's true talent lies. His best friend
Matthew's father is a baseball coach . . . but Matthew prefers the violin.
Although a bit too patterned, this story of of mix-matched family expectations
and the powers of best-friendship has a lively first-person perspective on being
the new kid in a new culture. Yingtao learns not to stand when a teacher enters
the room (alas); Matthew learns to use chopsticks. While many of the cultural
exchanges are on a fairly superficial level, the book has a sobering side, deftly
introducing the racism Yingtao's mother faces at the supermarket, the repeated
failure of Matthew's father to remember Yingtao's name, and the tight situation
Matthew's family is facing since his father has been laid off. The general tone is
light, though, and the reading easy. RS

"In the whole world, Grand Ma Mere loved two

loved to play tricks." Set in a magnificent Paris mansion, this is an arch-

jokes. It's not till he tries to fool proper-looking Grand Ma Mere with a black

comeuppance from all the servants he has plagued each summer. Veteran
storyteller O'Callahan knows his trade, and Santini capitalizes on fashionable
1920s attire with chic pen lines and elegantly modulated watercolors. Both
paintings and text are haute style, but young listeners will relish Pierre's
brattiness and relate, despite the upstairs-upstairs atmosphere, to a finale in

in the chaos and confusion with which we must live. The adaptation is spare,
with details shorn away for a primal effect. A note attributes the legend to a
turn-of-the-century medicine man, Hosteen Klah, though no textual source is
given for purposes of comparison. (Is the first phrase-"When the pulse of first

fancy?) 
Desimini's paintings maintain a surrealistic distance, with simply
focused compositions, dark colors, and smoothly sculpted shapes. Combined,

A frog named Winston narrates his history, beginning
with his capture from a pond to his life at the zoo. The dry text, written for
early readers, presents Winston's story seriously. The cartoon-like illustrations
display a wit that the text does not-a zookeeper hops high into the air to throw
a net over Winston, Winston tries to impress a scientist with the length of his
legs, a dejected Winston slumps in the holding tank, and Winston gnaws on a
cigar-shaped worm. The narrative could serve as zoo propaganda, since Winston
gradually comes to accept his role as a zoo-display as though he is fulfilling his
civic duty ("Winston-Working Frog"). He contents himself by watching the
"new faces, new hats, new coats" and is proud that he has "not missed one day of
work." This book contains a lot of information about bullfrogs and zoos, mixed
in with an undeniable lesson of conformity. KJ

In a sequel to The Sky Is Falling (BCCB 6/90)
Pearson continues the story of Norah-now thirteen-and her younger brother
Gavin, who have become thoroughly at home after three years as "war guests" of
a large, extended Canadian family. They cannot go back to England until the
war is over (it's now 1943) and life with the Ogilvies seems more real than
England, anyway. This is the story of an island summer and of Norah's
romantic love for one of the older cousins, Andrew. Andrew is being pressured
by his patriotic family to enlist while the fighting still goes on-but he confides
in Norah his misery at the prospect of killing someone. As she does with other
facets of the story, Pearson keeps the concept of pacifism in perspective; like
Norah's adoration, it is treated with dignity but never overwhelms the narrative
flow. This balanced and perceptive approach also governs the characterization;
the story is a worthy successor to the winner of the Canadian Library

Ten friendly stories about the Rabinowitz family
feature Abigail, the narrator; Sam, her brother; Dad, a cab driver; Mom, an ex-

Except for Benton, this is a conversational family, with Abigail retelling tales
their father has narrated about his fares-a famous actress, a wealthy boy taking
his goose to show-and-tell, a television producer who uses the children in a
show, a little girl on her way "to get chicken pox," a man masquerading with a
donkey head. Mom spins pretty good yams, too, and both kids seem to have
inherited the talent. Porte's own storytelling is varied and inventive; if there's
any weakness, it's in the occasional anticlimactic ending ("Chicken Pox," Parts I
and II, for instance). Overall, though, the humorous tone and easy text project
the same warm quality that has attracted beginning readers to her Harry series.
Abolafia's black-and-white cartoons have a tongue-in-cheek dash that polishes

Although this sports bio of an important African

There's lots of hype here, lots of sports page prose, but curiously little
information about the game of tennis itself or Garrison's style of play, which is
simply described as "fast." The sports history is weak as well: while Althea
Gibson is twice pictured, she's never mentioned in the text; and while the book
correctly states that the United States Tennis Association did not admit black

pushes Biff around, making him drive her to the store and buy her cigarettes;
blithely, she also apparently informs the beautiful Tommie that Biff has a secret

El Norte is the United States, and as Poynter states in
her introduction to these twelve personal narratives of illegal immigrants, "El
Norte represents their only hope of survival. They must work or their families
will starve." What Poynter does not say, nor is it indicated in any of the case
histories, is that many immigrants come and they and their families starve
anyway. Each of the chapters is a success story, sometimes a qualified one,
ending with a where-are-they-now postscript: "Despite the fact that each man is
sending $150 a month to his family in Guatemala, business is so good that they
have saved almost enough money to buy another truck and set up shop at
another street corner." There's a bleaker story at the core of the problem of
illegal immigration, but Poynter has not gotten at it. This is not to say that she
scants hard facts: all of the people profiled here (mostly from Mexico and
Central America, two from the Caribbean) had difficult, dangerous journeys, and
many have been sent back to their countries, only to return again. While in its
entirety the book gets repetitive, the individual escape stories are authentically
sad and scary, and some have the suspense of adventure fiction. They could be
fiction:-although there are photos of some of the subjects, Poynter does not
indicate where or how she got her material (and one reference to immigrants
working in "the stockyards of Chicago" is out-of-date; there are no stockyards in
Chicago). Like Brent Ashabranner's The New Americans: Changing Patters in
U.S. Immigration and Into a Strange Land (BCCB 9/87), however, this is a
personalizing perspective on an important dilemma. RS

The Darlings, "(for that is what everyone called them,
and so they thought it was their proper name)," are a family of dolls who live in
a posh London toy shop, and Mrs. Darling's greatest fear is that they will be
bought by a Serious Collector. "'Serious Collector' did not sound like someone
who would truly play with them. For dolls cannot truly come alive, cannot
have adventures or birthday parties or a cosy evening meal round the dining table
unless a child plays with them." The absence of a child, however, does nothing
to keep the little Darlings from enjoying these very things, and the book
consistently suffers from an inconsistent fantasy matrix. In any event, the
family is purchased by what appears to be a Serious Collector whom the dolls
call The American Lady (and nickname "Tally") and taken to America where they
undergo a series of small dramas that will be familiar to genre fans. Aside from
some talk among the dolls that sounds suspiciously like recovery jargon
("Emma, Emma, my dear, remember that each of us has his own needs and you
do not control everything") the story has a dated, sentimental tone that is not
helped by a surfeit of author asides ("And now you probably think this is the
happy ending. But if you've been looking at this book carefully, you'll know
there are more pages and the story isn't finished at all"). The closing revelation
that the American Lady is actually the author would be self-congratulatory if

A tale prominent in Zuni lore is here adapted to
picture book format with large-scale illustrations in desert-warm hues. The
message is unobtrusive, yet applicable to our own time through a story
smoothly told. The ancient Ashiwi people are so blessed with corn harvests that
they show off their wealth with a mock battle, throwing bread and dough as
weapons. After the godly Corn Maidens, disguised as beggars, witness this
travesty and are turned away by all but two children who offer them food, they
punish the people with a drought. It is a toy dragonfly that one of the children
fashions from corn leaves that intercedes with the Corn Maidens on behalf of the
starving children. Literal pictures have the textured effect of pastel and colored
[276 ]
pencil, with costumes and landscapes drawn in careful detail. The art has a
studied quality that is occasionally stiff but more often statuesque, as in the
scene of the villagers' trek against a bleak background of snow-covered mesas.

Native American cultures and make an unusual yet natural selection for special

who inhabit the windowless tower in the local museum. Mattie and her little

forces remain. Ever since the children's accident, the evil uncle has kept his life
in his body with electricity, but now he's searching for a new body to occupy.
Jerry is the intended victim. This spooky story has a great set-up, but it doesn't
live up to its potential. Jerry and the uncle never even see each other, much less
have the expected confrontation in the laboratory. There is too much time spent
on Jerry and Mattie's frustrated romance and not enough on action, or even on
any other character's reactions to Jerry's unusual behavior. Nevertheless, the
ghost story is effective because of Jerry's averageness-readers will identify with
him easily and start looking around for their own ghost friends. KJ

"We are only guests on the land," says sixteen-year-

relationship to the land, the past, and the Maori and white cultures of New
Zealand. Half-wild Fiona is white, but Maori-speaking and -identified, since her
traveling father leaves her under the eye of Maori friends in his almost constant
absence; Simon's biological father is Maori, and despite Simon's upbringing in
a white home and community he seeks a connection with his Maori origins;

reluctantly returned from his beloved American home. When Simon and Paul
travel in search of Simon's Maori father, they focus on the village where Fiona

her. Although she attempts to help Simon in his quest, she is distracted by her
attraction to both boys, disturbed by her own trouble with the past, and finally
devastated when her Maori "cousins" seek to lay tribal claim to the land she
hopes to inherit. Although the Maori are occasionally romanticized, the book is
both subtle and powerful, with an overlay of mysticism and sensuality that

past ("That's your blood," says Simon about Fiona and Paul's common

followed the westward trails to begin a new life. After painstakingly purchasing
their freedom, the Starks left Missouri, first to Salt Lake City, then to
California, and at last to settle on a British Columbian island where their

Annie Rye's father must have a uniform the family cannot afford. All these
events may have taken place-Smothers' first novel is autobiographical-but
they are crowded together into episodes that are simply too much to develop in
one short novel. The heavy dialect ("Brat done stuck up for me. She sho nuff
did") will have its champions as well as its detractors: on the one hand, it
[279 ]
represents authentic spoken record; on the other, it may summon stereotypical
images and deter less confident readers. The rural Georgia setting of the 1950s is
capably established in this first novel, as are the character dynamics of the
principal cast. BH

Yes, this is another picture book version of
Southey's aqueous poem; although it will inevitably be compared to the one
illustrated by Mordicai Gerstein (BCCB 11/91), with which it has some
similarities, it's an engaging romp in its own right. Here Papa Southey sits
firmly in his armchair, feet on hassock, informing his children "how the water/
Comes down at Lodore" while remaining oblivious to the cataract rushing
through his house (a portrait-the Duke of Wellington?-looks down in
dismay). Our diligent hero does not notice, despite his children's gestures, that
his chair, hassock and end table (complete with lamp) have been swept up in the
flood and are now carrying the family apace through the rapids. Although a bird
begins to nest in his lamp, and the children's hair and the dog's wiry ears are
streaming like banners from the velocity, nothing, neither precipitous drop nor
the passage of salmon in the other direction, will divert the poet from his
explanation. The humor here is broader than in Gerstein's version, particularly
the valiant efforts of the family mutt to guard the nest of eggs from harm, and
the closeups of Dad unperturbed in rolling waters that seem destined to douse
him, his offspring, and his really ugly orange plaid chair. The repetitive parts of
the text are left en bloc, possibly the better to speed through; the pen and
watercolor Constable landscapes and realistically depicted fish and birds blend
companionably with the more outrageous images of pets and family. Kids will
love the approach and the extraneous jokes-be sure to point out the now-
hatched eggs illustrated on the back flap. Don't think of it as a choice between
this version and Gerstein's, both topflight picture books; think of it as a chance
at two effervescent waterfalls in a genre full of mere dribbles. DS

Eddie's luck is always bad, according to Eddie. His
parents and teachers think most of Eddie's misfortunes are caused by the fact that
he plunges ahead before he stops to think. Eddie just blunders along-
accidentally siphoning out a school fish tank, rushing down a blocked-off
stairway during a fire drill, climbing on top of the gym lockers to rescue a
frisbee. His funniest mistake is when he doesn't listen to his medieval history
assignment and reports on "A Day in the Life of Fred, the Pheasant," complete
with a stuffed bird as a visual aid. Eddie means well, he just always does the
wrong thing. But he finds he has to start using his head when his grandfather,
Pop, gets out of the hospital and comes to recuperate with Eddie's family. Pop
helps Eddie both out of a tight spot and into some big trouble by including him
in a scheme to get Pop back to his own house. Stevens avoids heavy-handed
morals-if Eddie learns any lessons during Pop's stay he'll realize it later, like a
[ 280 ]
normal kid. Although the ending is a little weak, the family interactions are
always natural: "An eleven-year-old comedian. Or is eleven your IQ?" KJ

Admirers of Anthony Browne have learned to look
carefully in the corers of his pictures, and Gwen Strauss' readers know to read
between her lines (Trail of Stones, BCCB 4/90). Here is a picture book about
the recovery of Eric, who "did not like to talk." His alter ego, the Night
Shimmy, takes care of his emotional needs, including the dispersal of bad dreams
(which involve lizards) and companionship in games of spy. A girl in the park
changes all that, offering the quiet companionship of flying a kite shaped like
that verbal bird, the parrot. The Night Shimmy resists Marcia at first, but Eric
manages to reconcile his old and new selves in the end, when Marcia and Eric
make "silent wishes" and say goodnight. This could have been a case study, but
it is instead a series of spare, mysterious images that will capture children's
imaginations in much the same way as Sendak's work does. In fact, Mickey in
the Night Kitchen appears on the back cover of Eric's bedtime book. The black
frames around each picture give way at the end to open sky and a clear promise
of light (and flight). The art itself includes a stunning variety of Browne's
characteristic pattern-changing wallpaper, portraits that alter expression as they
watch the characters, a symbolic scene of Marcia and Eric romping in an apple
tree complete with serpent, and a luscious primeval forest scene with brilliant
parrots and a gorilla slipped in from one of Browne's earlier books.

Fourteen-year-old Deidre is smitten by Jeff, the
twenty-six year old composer/pianist who's moved into the Florida apartment
building where she lives with her mother. This is far from a formula treatment
of the not-smooth course of true love; Sweeney treats both the course of Deidre's
crush, and the supporting sub-plots about her mother (Deidre feels that her
mother ought to be more responsive to the man who's in love with her) and her
best friend (whose boyfriend gets treatment for exhibiting psychotic violence)
with a realism that avoids both rapture and tragedy. Jeff goes back to the woman
he loves but salvages Deidre's friendship. The plots are smoothly integrated, the
characters are well-defined and consistent, and the writing has, in both dialogue
and exposition, a natural flow. ZS

Gr. 7-12. 
Attempting to convey to junior high and high school
readers questions that have bedeviled thinkers for centuries, Terkel has set herself
a tough task; that she only partially succeeds can be faulted as much to the
[281]
complexity of her topic as to the watered-down treatment it receives here. The
book is excellent in describing the ways in which children as well as societies
develop moral codes; the reports of moral reasoning experiments done by social
scientists are intriguing. However, what Terkel often presents as self-evident
fact is actually opinion-a dicey proposition where ethics are concerned. In
discussing the Kitty Genovese case, for example, she states that while onlookers
should have called police, "bystanders have no moral commitment to risk their
lives to rescue someone else." That is arguable, something the author also
misses in an earlier discussion of My Lai, which she sees only as a conflict
between following orders or opting out of the killing. To ask "if we are selfish
and aggressive, as Freud suggested, can we learn to be good?" is a loaded
question that begs several definitions. (This same kind of slippery construction
is used later when Terkel states that "people who value self-interest set a very
different course from those who value justice," and it goes haywire when she
proceeds to say that the former tend to be interested in money and power while
the latter "choose helping or teaching professions.") To state that slavery and
sexism and apartheid are categorically "immoral" seems like simple virtue-
except to those, using the very methods of moral reasoning Terkel explains, who
don't agree. "Follow your heart," as Terkel advises in her closing chapter, is not
necessarily a dictum that will take readers where she wants them to go. RS

The title and subtitle say it all: Emma Lou Thayne
(mother) and Becky Markosian (daughter) here relate, in alternating sections, the
story of Becky's slide into mental illness after graduating from high school in
Salt Lake City. Becky's anorexia led to compulsive dieting and bulimia, but it
was not until a manic period in Seattle that her friends conspired with Becky's
parents to get her onto a plane, back to Salt Lake, and into a hospital. Recovery
was slow, and both mother and daughter credit the use of antidepressant medicine
for Becky's current stability and happiness (now thirty-nine, Becky is married, a
mother of three, and has a productive career). While the focus is on Becky, most
of the story, as told here, is the mother's, an empathetic and sensitive witness.
The book may have too much adult perspective (on both authors' parts) for some
adolescent readers; on the other hand, there's a welcome lack of troubled-teen
melodrama. While it's long and occasionally repetitive, here's a good, clear look
at a parent and child coming through hard times together. RS

Talk about lazy. On this farm, "the duck did all the

straight right off, with the fat farmer lolling in bed with the paper and a box of
bon-bons while the clearly long-suffering duck presents the next course. The
duck fetches the cow from the field, herds (on his back) the sheep, saws the
[ 282 ]
wood, does the ironing, all to the bedridden call, "How goes the work?"
Revolution is soon at hand, and the farmer is driven out of bed and off the farm,
where the animals create a worker's paradise of cooperation, celebrated by the
artist in a sunny double-spread that contrasts with the moody and miserable
weather that had held thus far. Oxenbury's animals are a superbly drawn and
empathetic bunch; her farmer a monument to sloth. Animal Farm without the
irony, this will undoubtedly inspire young couch potatoes to clean up their acts.

Laura is not happy to be suddenly moving across the
county during the last week of fifth grade, but her father, a farm hand, needs a
new position after being fired for telling off the alcoholic owner of the farm
where the family had lived. Ryan, Laura's soon-to-be-eighth-grader brother is
even more unhappy; he had big plans to star on the local summer baseball team,
and there's no team at all in their new town. In some ways, this is a sensitive-
girl's summer story, as Laura learns to love their new home, finds a special
place (the "Godmother Tree" of the title) to cherish, and grows to understand her
difficult brother and herself. That's a time-honored plot, but Wallace-Brodeur
writes forthrightly and freshly, allowing the rural Vermont setting to inform and
envelope the story without waxing excessively lyrical. 
There's some
sentimentality in a scene where Laura and her mother go to Gramma's house,
but the emotional effects, like the landscaping, are generally understated. The
book was originally published for the Vermont Migrant Education Program, an
association implicit in the theme that even though Laura has found security and
happiness in her Godmother Tree, the possibility of being uprooted again is
always before her. RS

Grace Darling, twenty-two, was alone with her
parents on the morning of September 7, 1838; during her dawn watch in the
lighthouse tower, she saw a shipwreck and persuaded her father that she was
capable of rowing with him on a rescue mission. This true event, and much of
the aftermath, have been used by the author to blend fact and fiction with
consummate skill in creating a narrative that is powerfully dramatic in its initial
impact and sharply observant in describing the consequent events. Idolized by
press and pulpit, Grace (who tells the story) is disturbed by the concurrent
animosity of those who feel they should share in the praise and the financial
rewards. Jill Paton Walsh, citing her sources in an appended author's note,
corroborates the fact that coastal residents expected and usually received a bounty
for a rescue mission. Grace was therefore resented because local residents, some
of whom had gone to the rescue not knowing that the Darlings had taken all
survivors back to the lighthouse, felt cheated. The characters are drawn with
depth and nuance, the language and idiom are appropriate to the place and period,
and the whole story has the tight-knit feel of a tapestry in word. ZS

A fine second novel by the author of Sweet Creek
Holler (BCCB 10/88) chronicles Tiny Lambert's high school years from 1956 to
1960, which include a realistic range of incidents lent suspense by the
protagonist's attempts to avoid and then overcome sexual abuse by her
stepfather, Vern. His characterization, along with those of Tiny's mother, the
rest of the family, and a cast of friends, is vividly rendered, the plot following
variably but believably from their patterns of action. Vern's portrayal, for
instance, is of a man soft enough to swap his most cherished possession, a gun,
for a dog he doesn't want just to hush his daughter's crying, yet selfish enough
to violate her. There's a lot going on in this story: subplots include Tiny's
discovering her musical talent, inheriting a mountain farm from her alienated
grandfather, and identifying a mysterious figure who has haunted her fantasies.
The end is telescoped too neatly, but the blend of family problems, peer
dynamics, and period details is ultimately a smooth one. BH

According to this literary creation myth, Mahtmi,
"the Blessed One," created the first man, Kwanza, in his image, that is, black.
Cultures across time and around the world have viewed God in their own images,
so there's no lack of precedent for this; however, the story becomes troubling
when Mahtmi gets around to creating the other races. "He created another being
out of the red soil of what we now know as Georgia, another out of the sandy
beaches of Normandy. .. another with horsehair for its head. .. fish eyes for this
one's eyes, and on and on after that fashion, biding his time till the original one
came home." Mahtmi loves all of his children, but Kwanza remains "the finest
creature 'cause he had created him first and was fond of him in a special way."
The idea that one race finds special favor with the Almighty has found terrible
expression in the 20th century; how would we feel, for example, about a story in
which God awards first place to the blonde and blue-eyed, because the "glistening
of his skin is second only to my own"? And in the end, when Mahtmi gives
Kwanza something special (curly hair) to raise his self-esteem, it seems a sad and
dubious honor that this "will set him apart from every other man forever."
While the storytelling here is overelaborate and sometimes confusing in its
narrative shifts and vague pronominal antecedents (too many hes), there are some
lilting, affectionate touches, and Kwanza's need for proof of his father's affection
is a feeling with which any child can identify. Roth's watercolor paintings are
finely drawn, sophisticated and a little cool, emblemizing rather than
characterizing, but their misty tones provide satisfying atmosphere. RS

Well-crafted, genuinely young adult short stories are
hard to come by, but the nine included in this volume, a recipient of the
Canadian Young Adult Book Award, qualify. Set in Nova Scotia, many scenes
are illuminated by vivid writing. Most of the protagonists and/or narrators are

adolescent girls in conflict with their mothers, though a few plots involve a
friend, cousin, or sister. Although the collection as a whole occasionally strikes
a repetitive thematic note, the characters are invariably delineated with a focused
clarity that will have readers wishing for longer fiction from the same author.
The tone is varied and the age appeal broad, ranging from the tragedy of a high
school student's denying her favorite teacher ("The Metaphor") and the
sophisticated irony in a tale of twins ("Waiting") to a family's romance with a
lodger or a thirteen-year-old's confessions about menstruation to a pen pal she
has mistakenly assumed to be another girl. While the adult characters form a
strong presence, the adolescent voices take center stage in a collection that could
inspire classroom discussion as well as leisure reading. BH

Sarah and Penny have a volatile relationship, but

it. Penny climbed high into the sugar-gum tree and announced that she wasn't
coming down until Sarah said she was sorry. Wrightson, one of Australia's
most eminent writers, shows (again) that she is as adroit in realism as she is in
fantasy: the social impasse is handled in distinctive style and with affectionate
humor as two sets of firm but tactful parents and a team from the Fire
Department try to talk Penny down. It's Sarah who succeeds, and both girls
make it clear-without being rude-that they're a team and can solve their own
