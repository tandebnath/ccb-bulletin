In a series of books that give interesting information about men
and women whose signal contributions have been recognized by their winning of a
Nobel Prize, the subtitles may be doubling misleading: first, there is no attempt
to include-or even to list-all winners in the category the book covers, and
second, some of the material in each book, while relevant, is not about the winners
of Nobel prizes. In each volume, Aaseng gives background history and discusses
the work of eight or nine Nobel Prize winners (not always chronologically
arranged) in adequate style, not too dry, not too exclamatory. Photographs (there
are many) are of variable pertinence; each volume has an index and a glossary. ZS

Sixth grade seems empty to Wendy after her best friend moves to
Thailand and she maneuvers to join a popular group and avoid the class outcasts.
The relationship she builds with Honor, a studious black girl who is fiercely
protective of her privacy, and Jeremy, a goodhearted but hyperactive boy, makes
her realize that friendships are built through trust and flexibility rather than
similarity. This is centered on a problem of immediate concern to young readers,
and the dynamics and dialogue are natural. At a few points, the plot seems
engineered to suit the theme, which is complicated by a subplot involving
Wendy's adjustment to a new step-family (her mother's husband and his three
children). The protagonist, however, is refreshingly "average" in her reactions and
capacities, and the issue of race relations is incorporated with honesty and aplomb.

Aylesworth and Rounds have teamed up before (Hush Up,

He blames a bear, so Hanna waits till he goes to the outhouse, rakes the wall with
claw-like marks and grabs the pig, leaving plenty of ursine clues behind.
Conviction by suggestion--case closed. Characteristically, Rounds' figures are
simply composed, black-outlined mountaineers posturing against plenty of white

star of the show, Hanna's Hog, is a ludicrous beast whose mustard color matches

Beginning with the arrival of an orphaned Jewish refugee at the
end of World War II, this details his absorption into a Galilee kibbutz until the
children's evacuation in the war of 1948. The dynamics among the characters are
realistically developed, including one boy's resentment of the allowances made for
the newcomer, another's sensitive alliance, and the role played by a dog in bringing
the children together. By the end of the book, the protagonist has accepted the loss
of his mother, whom he had hoped was still alive, as his best friend has accepted
the loss of her father on the European front. There are some touching scenes, as
when another refugee relives her bitter past with the evacuation truck's "taking
away" her daughter. The focus of the novel, however, is on new lives. While
we've had many novels about children's experiences in the Holocaust, this is one
of the few and the best on a survivor's adjustment in Israel. There are occasional
cases of stylistic awkwardness, but in general the translation is smooth and the
dialogue natural. BH

It's 1953, and 12-year-old Ellen wants to be "an ordinary
American girl," just like her new best friend Judy, who prizes chewing gum,
wearing makeup, "anything purple," dirty jokes and circle skirts. Hard as she tries,
though, Ellen cannot escape the un-ordinary secret she hides so desperately: her
parents are communists, "reds," says Ellen, afraid the smallest slip could send her

parents to jail like the Rosenbergs, or on the run like the comrades her family
hides. Her biggest fear, and resentment as well, is that her parents love "the cause"
more than they do her. They're all real fears--especially well drawn are Ellen's
parents' fierce dedication to their beliefs and naive blindness to their own daughters'
needs. This does stack the deck a bit against "ordinary" Americans, all of whom
are depicted as leading shallow and meaningless lives, and the ending (Ellen decides
no longer to "duck-and-cover" during air-raid drills) seems forced, substituting 80's

"You give but little when you give of your possessions. It is
when you give of yourself that you truly give." That little epigraph by Kahlil
Gibran introduces this equally banal fable of Tino, a good-hearted little boy who
gives away his family's TV set to Mrs. Sunday, the lonely old lady who lives on
the hill. At first unaccountably disturbed by this action, Tino's parents soon
realize the magnitude of the gift their son has given, not just to Mrs. Sunday, but
to themselves. As his mother says, "Tino is just a child, and yet he's wiser than
we are"-to which Tino's father (quite refreshingly) replies, "You mean you think
we should let her keep the set?" Well, yes, for the TV is a gift of love, or, as Mr.
Buscaglia more often has it, "feeling good." And Tino gets something just as
important in return: "a memory of happiness." This is the sort of nonsense that
writers for adults too often think they can get away with during their occasional
forays into children's books: patronizing, didactic, and dull. The illustrations are

With her particular talent for rendering sad situations from a
good-humored protagonist's perspective, Byars has written a very funny book
about the first love between two classmates whose teacher is desperately lovelorn
over an aerobics instructor. While Bingo's girlfriend, Melissa, returns his
affection, Mr. Markham is driven to a suicide attempt by rejection. There are
many points to admire here. One is the high-spirited reflection of classroom
conversations and dynamics, which Bingo observes during his perpetual journeys
to the pencil sharpener. A second is the smooth blend of plot and subplot, as the
reader realizes that it is the child who is normal and the adult who has lost control.
However, neither is stereotyped. Bingo grows wiser with the usual spurts and
setbacks of pre-adolescent realization. Mr. Markham is a sensitive, witty,
intelligent teacher who is unstable and makes a terrible mistake, but who has the
affection of his class and who recovers his balance. The honest, capable handling
of Bingo's guilt by his mother, who at first appears to be something of an airhead,

is another coup. There is a range of humor, from hilarious ("He, who had been in
love three times in one day and had already had four mixed-sex conversations!") to
ironic ("Bingo knew his name would not be picked. He had never been chosen for
anything in his life"). Maintained in both style and incident, these passages are
too numerous to mention, although some, like the description of Bingo's perfect

How is your mother, anyway?'") which, as usual, says she'll have to cut the

opened and read. "It came under their general heading of self-defense." Mom
(Miranda) has also decided to employ an after-school housekeeper; in the hope of
seeing more of his children, Dad (Daniel), a usually out-of-work actor, manages to
get the job-by getting up in drag as the magnificent and sublimely capable
dowager Madame Doubtfire. The kids catch on quick and are at first gleeful for
Daniel's company and the harmless (they think) deception, but then comes a
remarkable scene when Miranda, believing she has a friendly ear, spills all her
anger at Daniel to Madame. The children join in, at first playfully, and then with
barely disguised malice aim their own darts at the helpless target. While Daniel
gets most of the good lines ("'Fractions are useful,' Daniel told his son. 'Nobody
ever gets all they want out of life.'") it gradually becomes apparent that this wit is
also his weakness, a carelessness that can hurt his children. Miranda, at first
seeming a cold career woman, is equally revealed as a mother who works terribly

genuine pain (the first often expressing the second), showing, ironically and

photographs, this is also ecologically centered. Environment is inherent to the
conceptualization and organization as well as being the emphasis of a concluding
summary. In describing each creature's life cycle and characteristics, the authors
consider its place in a natural habitat and food chain. The sections on snakes,
lizards, crocodilians, and turtles include lively descriptions and immediate detail
("The Gila monster drags the lifeless body under a rock and munches it").
Stereotyped human reactions to reptiles are effectively countered with intriguing

Sixteen-year-old Laura describes her visit with a glamorous,
imperious grandmother-the potter whose balance and serenity Laura copies-
during a reunion of her mother's extended family. Mother, who's had a conflict
with Gran, is in England.) There's a fragmented romance, and a great deal of
juggling of family relationships as wealthy Gran organizes festivities to celebrate
the restoration of the village in which she owns so much property. Laura gains
confidence when she is pushed into taking responsibility and is successful, and this
enables her to gain perspective on her feelings about her parents. This is
adequately written if overpopulated, uneven in depth of characterization,
occasionally weak in the use of awkward phrasing or inappropriate action, yet it
has some interest as a family story. ZS

having a homosexual parent, in this case, a father. Nina, thirteen, is a "J.C.K."
(joint custody kid) who spends half the week with each parent. Her mother is
bitter and lonely; her father somewhat better off, spending a lot of time with best
friend Greg. That Dad and Greg are lovers will be sooner apparent to readers than

to Nina, who finds out on her birthday that Greg is moving into her father's
apartment. Smoothly, if with little depth, this tells of Nina's fears--of becoming
second in her father's heart, of his getting AIDS-and her eventual (and too abrupt)
adjustment to the situation. While not sexually explicit, this is familiar Klein
mood and milieu-an Upper West Side populated by kids much smarter than their
parents. Along the way, Klein tosses out a couple of bits of sexual information so
incomplete as to constitute misinformation: friend Dara sees a TV special on teen
pregnancy and says "Did you know there's only one day every month someone can
get pregnant? Maybe even less. Maybe just twelve hours," and, at another point,
Dad tells Nina that she doesn't have to worry about his getting AIDS because he's

defining smetana as sour cream on one page, while the glossary explains that

who seems to mistake him for someone else ("It's lovely to have you here.
There's no one quite like one of your own, is there!") and takes him to her home, a
decrepit building with an enormous purple water tap affixed to the front, courtesy
of Sophie's late husband, a plumber. The house is filled with junk and cats and
memories-all belonging and carefully placed, but in the wrong places: cheese in

While occasionally thematically overstated and psychologically obvious, this is

Beginning with an emphasis on the different shapes of eggs,
Selsam leads beginning readers through observations of caterpillar parts, variations
in physical appearance, and the process of metamorphosis. With her customary
adherence to scientific investigation, the author directs questions at the reader, who
can figure out answers from the distinctively drawn, green and gray pictures on
every page. Practical application comes with the suggestion to raise a caterpillar
("If it is a moth caterpillar it will spin a cocoon. If it is a butterfly caterpillar it
will start to harden and change into a chrysalis"). A concluding identification chart
summarizes common identification points to look for: hair, spines, pattern, body
movement, horns, forked tails, silky tents. 
The index comprises a list of
caterpillars featured in the book. BH

Service uses her own background as a student of archeology and a
participant in digs to give color and authenticity to the details of a fantasy in which
a prince of ancient Egypt appears in moder times and becomes the companion of
an archeologist's daughter. Part of the book is told as historical fiction, as Ameni,
whose twin brother will become Pharoah, copes with (or escapes) responsibility as
a royal prince. When the chapters shift to the present, he and Lorna go from Egypt
to London to retrieve a sacred relic, and these chapters are less convincing, as the
descriptions of Ameni's adjustment often include telescoped contrivance. On the
whole, a good read, though. ZS

Stylized paintings of the desert and its creatures illustrate a first-
person poem in the voice of the Mojave, who, it appears, speaks in rather pedantic
couplets: "The beavertails; the hedgehogs stout;/ The jointed chollas reaching
out;/ The barrel cacti, fat and round -I All live upon my arid ground." Minor's
paintings are beautifully colored, with some dramatic perspectives, but their
composition is overly formal -
not a prickle on a cactus, nor hair on a coyote
seems out of place, belying the wind and harshness and wildness claimed
(ineffectively) in the text. RS

Part of an astronomy series that already includes books on the
sun, stars, and four planets, this meets the challenge of conveying immensity by
analogy. In describing the more than three hundred billion stars that make up the
Andromeda galaxy, for instance, Simon says,"If you were to count one star per
second nonstop, it would take you more than nine thousand years to count the stars
in that galaxy." The measurement of light-years gets similar treatment, with
reference to time as well as distance: "The light from the Andromeda spiral that we
see today first started on its journey more than two million years ago, when our
ancestors lived in caves." Dramatic photographs, computer-colored against black
backgrounds, show the shapes of spiral, elliptical, barred spiral, and irregular
galaxies. Although a concluding statement asserts that the universe is without any
boundary, the map that "plots the locations of one million galaxies" unfortunately
undercuts this idea with a round frame. Outside of such nitpicking, this is a solid
addition to children's understanding of scientific phenomena. BH

"It looks like a combination postage scale and video camera,"
says the sixteen-year-old narrator, David, in describing the object labelled Spee-
Dee-Dupe that he's found on the beach. The object proves, indeed, to be a
duplicating machine-but only of living things. That is how David produces a
clone; the clone has all David's memories and claims he is the original David.
Who joins the family for dinner? Who appears at school? Who courts the
charming Angela, and who tells about what they said and did so that the clone
won't make a mistake? Above all, what do the two Davids do when a third turns
up, and how do they handle a growing animosity? There are some points in the
story when the roles of the clones (referred to as Duplicates A and B) become
congested to the detriment of the book's pace, but fantasy fans will doubtless find
the concept fresh enough and eerie enough to compensate for this, and Sleator is,

A trickster gets tricked in this clever folktale from Japan, with
delicately modulated illustrations that reflect stylistic and narrative techniques of
Japanese painting. Taro is a lazy boy who schemes to become the son-in-law of a
rich merchant by disguising himself as an ujigami and ordering the merchant to
marry off his daughter to "that fine lad who lives on your street" (Taro). Taro's
mother in turn tricks Taro into accepting a job as the merchant's storehouse
manager. "And as it turned out, the marriage is a happy one.... If he is not the
busiest man in town, neither is he the laziest." The pictures as well as the words
[ 168 ]
use an understated irony to suggest the duplicity and gullibility on display here. In
fact, several illustrations are witty parodies of well-known ukiyo-e woodcuts.
Contrasts of color and image are vivid but never exaggerated. The humor of
characterization does not detract from the aesthetic appeal of landscape and domestic
scenes. Lines are spare and meticulous, with each illustration framed in a black
brush-stroked rectangle. A satisfying picture book in every respect. BH

Encyclopedia Brown is the reason, of course, "better than a library for getting

few depending on special knowledge (that a tennis pro has one forearm bigger than

careful reading. (And, of course, Encyclopedia's ingenious solutions are found at

Both text and pictures here dramatize the elements that grab a
young listener's attention. The cover itself shows the ogre with long sharp teeth,
knife, and fork upraised over a defenseless frog. However, by mid-book, the frog
has jumped through the window and landed on the sleeping ogre's nose, where it
looks enormous. This trick of perspective frightens the ogre, who promises to
forego tasty little animals and goes on a diet of mushrooms. On discovering the
frog's true size from some taunting birds, the ogre is shamed into leaving the
forest forever. The hurly-burly lines and colors are uproarious. The ogre is a red-
bearded, green-eyed, hairy monster that fills every page of his appearance until the
small animals replace him with a triumphant dance on the last double-page spread.

A collection of fairy tales by Andersen, Cervantes, Hoffman,

remarkable for its play of light and shadow and the fidelity of costume detail;
within the boundaries of his style, however, there is a varied response to the classic
tales he is illustrating, so that the pictures for "The Emperor's New Clothes" are

eerie. The palette is rich but subdued, the page layout and book design impressive.

In a story set in rural Arkansas in 1946, fourteen-year-old Tessa
shares her father's interest in amateur archeology rather than her mother's social
ambitions and longing for town life. When Mama decides to leave her husband,
Tessa Mae is determined to spend the summer working outdoors with her father,
Roy Glen. Having a handsome college student on the dig makes the summer even
more pleasant. Still, by its end she has decided that "it wouldn't be right for her"
to live so casual a life. (Steiner doesn't make this decision a logical one). The
ambivalence is a facet of adolescent life with which most readers can identify, and
the family schism is convincing, but the story is weakened by the awkward and
inconsistent use of dialect and by the introduction of sub-plots that are tangential
and that slow the pace of the book. ZS

Divided into creation myths, a description of the gods, humans'
beginnings, heroes and heroines, popular legends, and the Trojan War and its
aftermath, this is more a folkloristic resource than a lyrical retelling. Preceding
each story is a brief note discussing its origins, both literary and oral, with
historical context or archeological descriptions wherever pertinent. This is an
ambitious project, not only for its scope but also for its attempt to relate the tales
as they are known in Greece today, with variants favored by different sections of
the country and with photographs of the locations. The canon is so large and
complex that occasionally the text takes on the tone of a catalogue, and there are a
few shortcuts: "the beautiful Helen (who caused all the trouble)" is a description
that considerably diminishes the concept of fate described elsewhere; there is also
no mention of Achilles heel ("As had been prophesied, Achilles was killed shortly
after he defeated Hector, but the war went on relentlessly, with casualties on both
sides increasing"). On the whole, however, this draws together and links an
extraordinary amount of material with vivid immediacy, an important contribution
to the cultural literacy of today's young people, who will be amazed and intrigued
at the outrageous behavior of gods and humans alike. BH

P.T. Barnum was a complicated mix of intelligence and humbug.
Tompert has assembled the facts of his life competently and attempted a
perspective, though some aspects of Barnum's personality and times dangle
problematically. After a disclaimer that "it was common practice for showmen to
exhibit curiosities in display rooms," the text acceptingly lumps deformed animals,
misshappen humans, and odd mechanical displays together in the service of
explaining Barnum's fortunes. The latter varied wildly from success to failure,
which Tompert attributes to Barnum's inability to trust the right people. She also
makes an effort to address his neglect of family through total submersion in work
and discusses his boundless energy and optimism in the face of many disasters. On
the other hand, some of his contributions seem overrated: "Jenny Lind's tour
marked the beginning of real music in the United States." Barnum's pioneer work
in advertising, however, is undeniable and well described here. With black-and-
