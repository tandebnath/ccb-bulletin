THE BIG PICTURE
The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid
Tales
by Jon Scieszka, illustrated by Lane Smith
Post picture books? Or what can we call them, the new wavy (but that's old)
picture books by artists such as Maira Kalman, Dale Gottlieb, and the author/
artist collaboration ofJon Scieszka and Lane Smith? These artists, who all bring to
picture books a new-art sensibility quite different from mainstream picture book
traditions, bring as well a new kind of storytelling, witness both The Stinky Cheese
Man and Gottlieb's Seeing-Eye Willie, reviewed further on in this issue. Unlike,
for example, David Wiesner's Caldecott-winning frog-fantasy Tuesday, these books
are rooted in a chancy, weird world. Tuesday is plenty weird, but in a cozy, Our-
Town kind of way-those frogs are our friends, and their story follows a funny but
inevitable trail: what goes up must come down. That's a theme in The Stinky
Cheese Man, too, but what comes down is the Table of Contents page, and it falls
on Chicken Licken, manically ("Ducky Lucky! Ducky Lucky! The sky is falling!
The sky is falling!") trying to catch a plane to warn the President. Like he'd listen.
Deconstructionists, welcome: You will have at least as good a time with
this book as will any third-grader on a nodding acquaintance with the basic folk
heroes of Western culture and of library story hours, such as Goldilocks, The Ugly
Duckling, The Frog Prince, and Little Red Running Shorts. What marvelous
liberties Scieszka and Smith take here, playing around with the entire cast of Into
the Woods but managing to be twice as funny as Stephen Sondheim. In these
"fairly stupid tales," the Frog Prince was just kidding ("and the princess wiped the
frog slime off her lips"); Little Red outruns the wolf ("My, what slow feet you
have"); Andersen's Duckling has a big problem: "Well, as it turned out, he was
just a really ugly duckling. And he grew up to be just a really ugly duck. The
End." And ugly as this Duck is-a gauche doofus with his tongue hanging out,
framed by his elegant siblings-he has our sympathies and our recognition: we
know that this is how the story really goes.
But kids don't need to be cynical to get these spoofs. They can cherish
Cinderella at the same time they can appreciate Cinderumpelstiltskin, "the Girl
who Really Blew It." They can chase after the Gingerbread Man, and bring the
same enthusiasm to dodging the Stinky Cheese Man. The fondness for the first is
the only thing that allows us to laugh at the second. It's cultural literacy with the
ante upped, showing kids a way to parlay the basics to levels of irony, social com-
mentary, and literary criticism, and extending the book to readers well beyond the
usual picture book age.

* THE BULLETIN
The jokes here don't stop with the stories. The introduction, for ex-
ample, zens introductions: "If you read this last sentence, it won't tell you any-
thing." Similarly, the upside-down dedication page urges readers on to better
things: "Whoever looks at that dedication stuff anyhow? If you really want to read
it-you can always stand on your head." An endpaper, courtesy of narrator Jack,
shows up in the middle of the stories: "Shhhhh. I moved the endpaper up here so
the Giant would think the book is over." The Little Red Hen, who has nagged her
way through the entire volume, turns up on the back cover to kvetch about the
ISBN. Such bibliometricks-meta-tricks?-are entirely at home in this jigsawed
tale-type storyworld, which is as dark, the pictures tell us, as the Grimms'. Bertolt
Brecht and Edvard Munch lurk just beyond these illustrations, which present a
sinister fairyland cabaret. "Rendered in oil and vinegar," the pictures are funny
but spooky: the smell lines wafting from the Stinky Cheese Man reek of some-
thing stranger than cheese; the giant's face as he eats the bread (and the little red
hen who made it) leers like a fallen man-in-the-moon. The effect, though, isn't
scary, because the book is too funny and, besides, it keeps reminding us that it's a
book. The book also keeps reminding readers that they're reading, a tap on the
shoulder that feels less like a monitory nudge than it does a congratulatory slap on
the back.

The rules: each page (or double-spread) must have its palindromic phrase while a
simple line drawing illustrates; punctuation and capitalization do not count; and
colloquial spellings are acceptable. That description, however, hardly captures the
inspired lunacy of Go Hang a Salami, I'm a Lasagna Hog (read that title back-
wards); it's like a mad lexicographer's alphabet soup. Agee scales narrative heights
with his palindromes ("Mac snubs Bob's bun scam"), demonstrating fearlessness
in the face of apparent absurdity ("Tell Abe to vote ballet" is quite logical in its
given context, when one tutu-clad dancer says it to another as our sixteenth presi-
dent casts a ballot for waltz, polka, ballet, rumba, cha-cha, or mazurka). The
simple, cartoonish illustrations have stories of their own to tell, giving "No, son" a

be reassured by the cartoon-book size, shape, and format, and any kid who's writ-
ten out his or her name backwards will catch the spirit and follow the game (as did
the publishers: note the book's palindromic price and ISBN number). It's a gen-

"Wouldn't swap my fruitcakes for the world," says the genial driver of the special
education bus about his riders. This British novel examines, chapter by chapter,
the lives of the kids who ride that bus: there's Rebecca, who has Down's Syn-
drome and who's being cheated out of her long-awaited post as bridesmaid in her
beloved sister's wedding; there's Micky, in a wheelchair and incapable of compre-
hensible speech, who wants desperately to be free of his doting mother and to
experience his awakening sexuality; there's emotionally disturbed Fleur, who has
finally found a home where she feels secure after much rejection. Point of view
varies from chapter to chapter, with third-person narration for most, but speech-
less Micky narrates his own story, and Gail tells of her brother Thoby, brain-
injured in an accident but still in love with music. There's a small story hinting at
a much larger one in each chapter, with another subtle but significant episode
linking all the bus riders at the end, but Anderson's main achievement here is to
evoke the lives of young people who frequently pass unconsidered by the rest of us.
The petty meannesses toward and among the kids are depicted well enough to
make readers thoughtful, and it's also clear that these children have wishes, suc-
cess, failures, and relationships (siblings come off quite well, but parents rather
poorly). This is an engaging and reflective series of portraits. DS

In Nothing but the Truth (BCCB 9/91) Avi told his story through a variety of
conversations, diary entries, letters and memos; here, he relies entirely on the spo-
ken word, mingling conversations (their speakers left unidentified) with transcripts
of 1940s radio theater as heard by a boy only too ready to imagine himself a hero
along the lines of the Lone Ranger or the Green Hornet. Frankie isn't a bad kid,
but he is an impulsive and annoying one, trying the patience of every adult within
his vicinity, including his parents, the family's boarder, Mr. Swerdlow, and his
teacher, Miss Gomez: "Franklin, once again you will stay after school." Even
Frankie's sidekick, the practical and literal Mario, is reluctant in face of Frankie's
main scheme: to trap Mr. Swerdlow as an enemy spy so that Frankie can have his
own room back. Avi's good ear for dialogue serves him especially well here; what's
more remarkable, given the contrivance of technique, is how naturally the story
moves, and how quickly readers-like radio fans of old-will get used to doing
without the conventional trappings of fiction. Each voice is distinct, the comedy
is unforced, the wartime setting (and sadnesses) arise easily from the talk. The
ultimate effect is a paradox: readers can close their eyes and listen. RS

Mom is reading to Baby Gray, a young rabbit, a bedtime story about Rodney:
"Rodney Rabbit lives in a cabbage. In it, he has ... a celery phone to make a call
on, a radish doll to hug and an eggplant desk to sit behind." Then, according to
Mom, Rodney reads a book about Baby Gray, who "lives with his family in a
hollow under a tree. The Grays' favorite pastime is eating," and they scarf down
the same kind of vegetables that make up Rodney's house "till no one can eat
another bite"; then the Gray family in their book, Rodney Rabbit in his book, and
Baby Gray in this book all doze off. It's a little convoluted, but kids will understand
and appreciate that the gray bunny is in the white bunny's book and vice versa.
Barasch explores the vegetable house idea with enough detail to make it funny
rather than merely cute, and the cruditds are a crisply constant theme throughout.
The line and watercolor illustrations give the vegetables a cozy kitchen-wallpaper
look, and the slightly humanoid rabbits have a Thurberesque individuality to them.
This'll give young herbivores and others a fanciful new slant on Mr. McGregor's
garden and its denizens. DS

Ellie grows exceptional pumpkins, big enough to compete in the Rock River Har-
vest Fair for the title of The Biggest Pumpkin in the State of Iowa. Ellie relies on
the support of her grandmother and cousin for her obsession, because her wid-
owed dad's low opinion of farming makes Ellie defensive. Ellie perseveres in grow-
ing Max, her champion pumpkin, despite storms, animals, and, worst of all,
pumpkin thieves, who poach the giant vegetables for Halloween profit. She allows
herself to be distracted from her cause only by the new boy in town, who grows
corn and doesn't seem to mind Ellie's spare twenty pounds. This first-person
narrative of a sixteen-year-old is told with humor and tenderness, moving easily
from cousin Richard's opinion of first-year teachers who "couldn't help them-
selves, having been filled with all that poop in college," to Ellie's description of her
mother's death; from Ellie and Dad's capture of a pumpkin thievery ring to Nana's
advice about competition ("Four generations of Morgans worked that soil to get it
how it is, sweating themselves silly in the field, and I don't want you messing
things up by thinking that winning today is more important than that"). Ellie is a
determined character who knows who she is and hails from a loving and complex
family. Even readers who have never planted a seed will admire Ellie's passion for
growing things. KJ

Truth is brave, plucky, and inclined to speak her mind, and she is soon caught up
in the Bardwell family's secret work: helping escaped slaves along the Under-
ground Railroad to the North. The author works in a great deal of information
about the pacifist Quakers' courageous resistance during the Civil War, but the
exciting story never falters in service to the history. Truth helps hide slaves under
the fireplace and in a secret cave; she travels along the Underground Railroad
herself after her cousin has been captured by Yankees and imprisoned in New
York. Here events involving Frederick Douglass and Mrs. Lincoln become a bit
unconvincing, but the narrative hand remains sure and easy to read. Appended
notes supply information about the Quakers and historical figures in the book. RS

Mysterious, long-lost Aunt Louisa has just died, and eleven-year-old cousins Tory
and Emily indulge in romantic fantasies about her upcoming funeral: "Won't it
be great if Uncle Arthur throws himself across the coffin, sobbing uncontrollably?"
asks Tory dreamily. Louisa's husband Arthur, however, is dour and dogmatic,
seeming hardly worth the girls' imaginative efforts. The cousins' desire for a ro-
mantic gesture leads them to make an illegal nighttime visit to'the cemetery (to
place flowers on Louisa's grave at midnight), but Emily finds out more about the
spirit of true love while helping Uncle Arthur clean up the grave the next day. The
characterization here is believable, with irritating and charismatic Tory leading
Emily into adventures small and large, while Uncle Arthur's and Emily's quiet
attachment is genuine enough to make his eventual death quite saddening. Bechard
is deft with smaller touches as well, such as Emily's great basketball moment when,
in front of her great crush, she sinks her shot and splits her shorts. This is a well-
balanced account of a young girl who's beginning to realize that her relatives are
real people, and that there's a difference between adolescent fantasy and true love.

Begay's vigorous watercolor and color pencil pictures illustrate a tale of Coyote's
greed backfiring once again when he swallows his cousin Horned Toad in order to
own and eat all the corn that Horned Toad has worked so hard to grow. It doesn't
take Coyote long to realize he's made a mistake, as Horned Toad pulls Coyote's
ribs, lounges around in his stomach, and pinches his heart. The tale is a satisfying
one for preschool storytelling sessions or primary-grade students of Native Ameri-
can lore, and the art, though occasionally crowded in its reliance on mottled tex-
tures and circular background lines, has some intriguing shadowy effects, includ-
ing a traditional icon of the horned toad stylized among more literal images. A
note about "Coyote Out Walking Stories" and a glossary of Navajo words, with a
pronunciation guide, are appended. BH

Here's a photoessay to generate envy: Jasmine is eight, and she's training her
pony-and herself-to enter a local pony race. Her mother's a riding instructor
and her father's a blacksmith; Jasmine gets to take care of and ride Charlie, a
doughty steed even if he is the smallest one around. (She also participates in Pony
Club, where she rubs elbows with hot young steeplechase jockey Blyth Miller.)
Training isn't all smooth sailing: sometimes Jasmine falls off, or Charlie bolts
(practice races are held in a fenced paddock because "it's safer here than in an open
field in case one of the ponies decides not to stop"). Finally the great day comes,
and Jasmine in her cotton-candy pink silks and brave Charlie come seventh in the
race, but run the distance in their fastest time ever. It's a kick-as it were-to see
such a young rider in such an exciting event rather than the more sedate and usual
horse show, and this book has all the alluring horsey details that fans crave. A few
photographs seem posed, but they're generally clear and vivid in depicting Jasmine
in her equine milieu. Pair this one with Patricia Easton's Stable Girl(BCCB 10/91)
for horse-oriented kids who want deeper immersion in horsekeeping than is of-
fered by Krementz' A Very Young Rider (BCCB 5/78). DS

Set in ancient Nubia, this sequel to The Dragon and the Thief(BCCB 12/91) is
even more exciting than its predecessor. Two Egyptian men, Prahotep and Baki,
and their unusual companion, Hathor the dragon, sail right out of the first story
and into this one-looking for other dragons in Nubia. Before they get a chance
to search, they find themselves embroiled in local politics. From the moment they
rescue a Nubian princess who's been left as a sacrifice for a hungry water monster,
they are committed to helping the princess return to her rightful throne. There's
action around every bend of the river as the friends race to get the princess back to
her capital city before an evil general takes over the country. The companions are
true heroes: Prahotep is clever, Baki is strong, the princess is brave, and Hathor is
magical. The message that Egyptians and Nubians can get over generations of
hatred through friendship is a clear but light-handed racial commentary. The
constant action, theme of friendship, and exotic setting make this book as success-
ful as the first. KJ

lems faced by migrant farm workers. "They want us to work," says twelve-year-old
Juan, "and they want us to disappear." When Juan and his parents aren't traveling
north to pick crops in California's Central Valley, they live in a migrant camp in

the rough chaparral near San Diego. "Houses" are made of plywood and plastic
scraps; there's no electricity or running water. Juan only intermittently attends
school and the migrants routinely face eviction and discrimination; the fact that
they are working in this country legally is no protection against dishonest employ-
ers. The black-and-white photographs show great poverty but no sensationalized
squalor. There is no "bright side" to the story, which is an excellent companion/
introduction to Brent Ashabranner's Dark Harvest (BCCB 12/85). RS

"Sing to the sun/ It will listen/ And warm your words/ Your joy will rise/ Like the
sun/ And glow/ Within you// Sing to the moon/ It will hear/ And soothe your
cares/ Your fears will set/ Like the moon/ And fade/ Within you." Ashley Bryan's
"Song" introduces a lyrical collection of 23 poems accompanied by fluid paintings
reminiscent of Chagall's overlapping images though marked with sharper color
contrasts. Many of the poems center on Caribbean rhythms and references, but
the mood is varied from lilting ("Sweet Talk," "The Blackbirds' Party") to thoughtful
("The Artist," "Pretty Is"). Children will feel the deeper meanings in "Do Good":
"Donkey want water/ Birdies want food/ Somebody ought to/ Do them good//
Birdies got a mama/ Papa on the go/ Bring them food and water/ Feed them, too/
/ Donkey tied proper/ He holler, he bawl/ No mama, no papa/ To feed him at all."
Most of the verses harbor promising sound effects, especially "Hurricane" ("The
wind howled,/ 'Whooree!/ I blow as I wish/ I wish/ I crush and/ I splash and/ I
rush and/ I swish."'). Read these aloud and then let the kids follow suit-the
words are simple but they dance, while the art achieves just the right combination
of swirling symbols and literal figures to enrich rather than distract from the verbal
nuance. BH

It's another boring summer day, and Mike's mom has sent him to the Stop and
Spend for cookies to accompany the family barbecue. Taking a short cut through
the woods, he spots instead a tempting bake shop and a funny little baker who sells
him some delicious-looking animal cookies, one for each in the family: "a rabbit
for Mike, a pig for Rose, a chicken for Mrs. Tracy, and a nice frog for Mr. Tracy."
Readers who spot the "brain muffins" and "lady fingers" in the baker's case wouldn't
touch those cookies with a ten-foot spatula, but Mike and his family don't even
wait for dessert, eat the cookies, and slowly begin to acquire the behavioral and
physical characteristics of their respective cookies. "'Ga-dunk!' said Dad. He
stuck out his tongue to catch a fly." Face it, this is the kind of book that you will
think is incredibly stupid but kids will eat right up-which is exactly what you
want in an easy-reader. Cartoon illustrations reminiscent ofSyd Hoffjoin right in
with the suburban lunacy, featuring an especially fetching mom clucking away in
her wheelbarrow nest. RS

square snow flakes and rounded mounds of cloud and snow give a comforting
organic feel to the lullaby, which will calm the most fearful toddler as it seems to
have done the sleeping Native American child trundled on the last page. The
format itself is spaciously designed, with double-spread pictures snuggled against a

"Once upon a sea" the sailor who stars in this picture book adventure "was known
from longitude to longitude, from latitude to latitude, for his great seamanship
and incredible luck." His seamanship doesn't help much against the storm that
wrecks his ship, but his luck holds at last, after a lifetime of Robinson Crusoe
survival on a deserted island. The story is skillfully straightforward, its energy
invested in prose that rocks with the rhythm of ocean waves. Egielski's illustra-
tions draw a fine line between honoring the seriousness of the story and lightening
its effects with controlled shapes and modulated colors. In the blue-and-green
storm scene, for instance, a giant wave-stylized like a Japanese painting but filled
with a more ominous power of movement-curves over the rain-driven ship. This
brand of fantastical realism is tonally reminiscent of Ardizzone's young maritime
voyagers (though the art and narrative bear more resemblance to Van Allsburg's
Wretched Stone) and should hold listeners with a similar promise of heroic action.

without thinking about briars or snakes or whatever else waits below the steep

those childhood incidents that can teach a lifelong lesson without a word spoken:
"We didn't tell anyone .... And we didn't take the short-cut again." The life-or-

Petey Moroni's diary of his two weeks at camp focuses on two things: comics
("Samurai Surfer meets Bonzai Dave for only the second time, and this time on
earth") and food, especially the disappearing act every camper's edible treasures are
performing ("Nancy Patanky knew she had three boxes of individually wrapped
fruit-flavored Puff n' Stuff Pastries she bought from home, but two whole boxes
were missing"). Even after a raccoon is identified as the culprit, the kids' ingenuity
is no match for that of the raccoon, who has clearly won this summer's round
("Ollie found nothing but a hole where he put his Caramel Crunchies"). The
illustrations are slickly and robustly goofy, if occasionally somewhat luridly col-
ored, with boys and girls in all shapes and colors remaining oblivious to the raccoon's
constant peeking; the critter itself has a strongly human attitude as it lies sleepily
among the snack food wrappers and then dons a camp T-shirt. Since no introduc-
tions are provided, it may take young readers a bit to figure out which kid is Petey
Maroni, but it's always clear what's going on. Cummings uses some nicely hu-
morous specificity, such as the strategic employment of food brand names and
comic book heroes. You won't learn much about camp activities here, but both
the protagonists and the readers should find Runamok an entertaining camp expe-
rience. DS

While the Darlings may be a little too eager to anthropomorphize their subject-
"They really are as mean as people think they are"--one can understand the temp-
tation, faced with the fact that, aside from humans, the main threat to the marsu-
pial Tasmanian devils is themselves: "the number one killer of baby devils is other
devils." Primarily nocturnal, Tasmanian devils live alone, spending only a few
months out of their mother's pouch before she forces them away (or kills and eats
them). The Darlings' account of these "genuine tough guys" is personalized (mother
and daughter observed, photographed and fed the devils at Cradle Mountain Na-
tional Park) and enthusiastic, describing a devil "cramming lengths of intestine
into his mouth like bloody spaghetti." The photos, primarily teeth shots, are often
cute, notwithstanding the Darlings' assertion that the devil is one of nature's
"unhuggables." A page of "Devil Facts" and an index are appended. RS

Left with his troupe of baby animals in a small, almost deserted village while the
rest of the circus travels on, Jingle the little clown boy brings Christmas to the
lonely old villagers. This is an awful lot of sentimental button-pushing for one
little picture book, but while the pathos seems somewhat calculated, the pictures
tell a better story. Beginning with Bonjour, Mr. Satie (BCCB 3/91), dePaola's
work has become a lot more interesting, with a broader but subtler palette that has
an emotional weight often lacking in his earlier books. The coloring here is posi-
tively voluptuous, with rich pinks and orchid blues accenting the aqua-gray
backgrounds, and if Jingle himself sometimes seems a little too fey, the dignity of
the old villagers is quietly conveyed in the deep browns and blacks of their clothing
and the strength of their bearing. The baby animals are doe-eyed adorable (espe-
cially the wolfhound pups), but with a strangeness about them that leavens the
cuteness. RS

Morning Girl and her brother Star Boy alternately narrate chapters describing
their everyday lives just before the arrival of Columbus to their island. Binding the
somewhat disparate episodes are strongly braided family dynamics: sibling rivalry
and reconciliation, mutual sadness over the loss of a new baby, the comforting
spiritual presence of a dead grandfather when Star Boy is overtaken by a hurricane,
reassurance from the children's parents, teasing from their relatives. It is the subtle
complexity of these developments that underscores the irony of Columbus' jour-
nal, excerpted unexpectedly as the epilogue: "... it seemed to me that they were a
people very poor in everything. . . . They should be good and intelligent
servants ... at the time of my departure I will take six of them from here to Your
Highnesses in order that they may learn to speak." The first juvenile novel to be
written from the Tainos' standpoint, this will offer a persuasive counterpoint to
the cabin-boy's-view historical fiction that has--except for Francine Jacobs' non-
fiction The Tainos (BCCB 5/92) and Jane Yolen's picture book Encounter (BCCB

This Nigerian folktale is oral in every sense, for its primary image is an edible sky

sometimes like ripe pineapple." Free of arduous labor, the men and women can
concentrate on art, weaving, and storytelling; but of course, where there is an Eden,
there is an Eve-in this case a greedy woman who disobeys the sky's injunction
against wasting its gifts. The sky recedes in anger, and the people must till the land

Faced with the sad conundrum of "Seeing Eye Willie," an old man who always sits
in front of Spike's Stationery, a little girl tries to puzzle out his story-"Maybe
Seeing Eye Willie doesn't have a home. Maybe he doesn't want a home. Maybe
he'd like my home"-and comes up with a fantastical tale that follows Baby Willie
around the world. A lion accidentally blinded Willie's eye in Africa, an Indian
mother elephant gives him a ride to China, a monkey gives him the embroidered
slippers ("These slippers will grow with your feet. They will tell the story of you")
that Willie always wears. The innocence of the narration is complemented by the
post-modernish paintings, flatly-planed and boldly colored, that convey the girl's
naively optimistic attempt to explain Willie's silent presence. Unlike many recent
picture books that sentimentalize the homeless (see Komaiko and Cornell's Leonora
O'Grady, BCCB 5/92), this one instead concerns a child's instinctive empathy. In
the end, the girl knows that her story is not Willie's story, but "if he ever wants to
tell it, I hope I'm there to listen." Flap copy ("Dale Gottlieb offers one vision of a
man some might call homeless but others would say has made a home where he
is") is a cheap come-on that entirely misses the point of this offbeat and distinctive
portrait of a girl's attempt, through storytelling, to right a perplexing world. RS

Although the conditions resemble the Depression Dustbowl, the year is 1975.
With drought threatening everything they plant on their farm, Lindy and her
father are putting in some tomatoes when a wall of red dust hits their house and
sends a young stranger stumbling into the door. He says his name is Drylongso,
an old African-American term for periods of dry weather. Drylongso stays with
Lindy's family long enough to help them find a spring with his dowsing stick,
which he leaves behind for Lindy the day he moves on to find his own family.
Illustrated with rusty-brown watercolor full- and double-page spreads, this is a
blending of picture book, short story, novel, and folklore; in a few places, the stress
points show, as in the case of information about twenty-year drought cycles trying
to work itself into conversation. For the most part, however, the strange drama of

Using a question-and-answer format that adds a gently riddling tone to this superb
sequence of photographs, Hausherr here introduces the musical instruments that
most young children will find familiar and/or appealing. "What instrument is
played sideways and can sing like a bird?" The question page has a color photo of
a young boy holding a flute; the verso has a black-and-white photo of a woman
playing a flute, captioned by a brief, informative paragraph about the instrument.
The photographs have a great variety of tone, from the adorable to the elegant to
the witty-one of the best shows two boys playing cellos, one with wary earnest-
ness, the other with the panache of du Pre. Often, the flip from question photo to
answer photo provides illuminating contrast: a bespectacled young black girl in
lace and velvet plays what has to be some impossibly serious music on the violin;
the verso pictures a down home Vermont farm family harmonizing on their fiddles.
More directly informative than Ann Hayes' Meet the Orchestra (BCCB 3/91) this
book also has a welcome and unselfconscious mix of boys and girls; black, white,
Hispanic, and Asian kids. Valuable appended material includes notes on other

This epistolary novel chronicles twelve-year-old Rifka's journey from Russia to
America, interrupted in Poland when she almost dies of typhus and in Belgium
when the ringworm she has contracted on a freight train prevents her from board-
ing the ship with her family. From then on and through her stay on Ellis Island,
she is alone except for the letters she writes to her cousin in the blank pages of a
book of Pushkin's poetry. This device seems a little unbelievable, since Rifka's
letters run to 145 pages, but the story itself is credibly developed and the voice
convincing. Rifka's detainment leaves her realistically disillusioned about the im-
migrant experience: "You have to be perfect to come to America. I have this bald
head and you, you have a crooked back .... We are not welcome." A number of
novels have focused on the experience of Jews in Russia or new arrivals to the U.S.;
this one is vivid in detailing the physical and emotional toll exacted for passage.

little sister Annie Rose play store; Alfie and his father sleep out in a field; Alfie finds
a pet rock and loses it at the beach. Using the last as an example, it is remarkable
how much drama Hughes generates from simple situations, and anxious listeners
will be relieved when "Bonting," still wearing the little bathing suit Alfie's mother
made for it, turns up in Annie Rose's beach bucket. Occasional poems inter-
spersed between the stories are a little too ordinary, cozy but prosy. Hughes' line-

Based loosely on "a north country legend," according to the jacket flap, this is the
story of the friendship between a big Newfoundland dog and a tiny cat. Newf
mysteriously comes out of the rough sea and proceeds to make his home in an
abandoned cottage, where Kitten is also holed up; at first Kitten is afraid of the big
animal, but he gradually comes to rely on his companion for warmth and comfort.
Newf, true to his rescue-dog heritage, saves Kitten twice: once when the cat has
been swept into the sea and another time when Kitten is buried in the winter
snow. Although the animal figures are somewhat approximate, the illustrations
are moody and effective, with thickly pigmented golden evening light illuminating
the quiet white kitten and the bearlike dog, or gray-green waves spewing white
spume over Kitten as he attempts to withstand the watery onslaught. The com-
plete absence of humans from this story gives it a quiet serenity that in no way
detracts from the charm of this odd couple's story, which is sort of like a stationary
Incredible Journey. The final snow rescue is a trifle anti-climactic, since we've
already seen the sea rescue, but it's still a good animal story, and Killilea writes a
suitably legendary opening and closing that should make this a successful read-
aloud with the pet set. DS

Pretty Polly progresses from eat wheaties, which Abigail selects because of the pho-

vocabulary (Polly seems a mentally average chicken). The story generates some
tension through Abigail's warding off threats of unwanted publicity and an even
more unwanted fox, but King-Smith relies, as he did in Ace, the Very Important Pig
(BCCB 12/90), on lively episodes rather than on the sustained plot and arch tone
of Foxbusters (BCCB 10/88). Although Pretty Polly is not as clever as either of
those books, it's easier to read, with the built-in appeal of a friendly human pro-
tagonist and the inherent humor of a talking chicken. BH

Ranging in age from six to sixteen years, a dozen children talk about their disabili-
ties. There's a variety of daunting genetic problems, accidents, and diseases, but
the voices have a common courage and resolve that will impress readers, who can
gain considerable perspective from the tragedies these subjects have overcome. Few
of us pause to consider what it's like to be born with missing facial bones (Treacher
Collins disorder), missing arms and legs (thrombocytopenia absent radius), bro-
ken bones (osteogenesis imperfecta); to have diseases like cerebral palsy or retina
blastoma bilateral, a cancer that required the removal of both eyes in the 13-year-
old interviewed here; or to have accidents such as the airplane crash that killed
another girl's father and paralyzed her with a spinal injury. Although a few of
these kids acknowledge moments of bitterness, they are sustained by strong par-
ents and complex medical support, making the book a positive introduction for
readers unfamiliar with the differences of the disabled. The first-person narrative
form also sets up a tone more intimate than that of books such as Thomas Bergman's
equally informative series, Don't Turn Away (BCCB 2/90). BH

Listing the many hats she has worn through the years, Kathy recalls sunbonnets,
dress-up hats, and bathing caps, but then "something happened to me . . . that
doesn't happen to many children": Kathy has cancer. She hates being sick, she
hates the treatments, and she hates, most of all, being bald, so that while her friends
have "bangs and barrettes and ponytails and curls . . . all I had was hats." But
Kathy personalizes her hat with badges and buttons and eventually, with her whole
class following suit, celebrates her remission by throwing her hat in the air. While
this book is quietly straightforward about the fear and pain of a life-threatening
disease, its real strength lies in its understanding of the draining indignities of
chronic illness: Kathy's feeling ugly and awkward is a serious predicament, and
Krisher (who writes in an afterword of her daughter's successful battle against can-
cer) addresses it as such. She also treats Kathy's cancer as one difficult episode of
an entire life, since the book depicts a time before the cancer and ends with Kathy,
her hair regrown, contemplating the promise of an after. The illustrations are
simple line-and-watercolor, airy and bright with lots of white space but never sac-
charine. This is a matter-of-fact book (previously published, with different illus-
trations, in a small private edition) about a tough time and subject, and its calm

Krull's informative notes and Garns' versatile pastel illustrations enhance this col-

have entered the folk canon, such as Malvina Reynolds' "What Have They Done
to the Rain." The arrangements, which include guitar chords, are clean and simple
("without being boring," as the compiler/arranger correctly notes), easy enough
for adults remembering long-ago piano lessons as well as for kids just beginning.
Krull's tempo and tone directions ("Spunky," for "Oh, Susanna," "Like an opera
singer," for "I Gave My Love a Cherry") are clever without cuteness, and the wide
variety of the anthology-work songs, cowboy sagas, spirituals, protest songs, etc.,-
encourages an equal variety of possibilities for use, including classroom singalongs,
bedtime story hours, and family recreation. Garns does an admirable job of wed-
ding image to music: "Down in the Valley" faces a full-bleed picture of a pastoral
setting framed by prison walls; his sketch for "Stewball" streaks a racing horse and
rider against a vibrant aqua sky. The notes that preface each song give interesting
bits of both musical and American history; first-line and song-type indexes are
appended. Handsome, useful, unstuffy and lots of fun, this is the perfect contem-
porary companion to Margaret Boni and the Provensens' classic Fireside Book of
Folk Songs, an antecedent Krull acknowledges in her preface. RS

In the universal tradition of sister-rescues-brother tales (e.g. "Baba Yaga," Andersen's
"Snow Queen," Sendak's Outside Over There), Le Guin has set this original story
in the gloomy winter woods of Sweden. After the girl's brother is stolen by trolls,
their parents are helpless with grief, so the girl fills her pockets with her treasures
and sets off. Le Guin's poetic language ("Her mother's voice was like a fine, thin
thread of silk or silver that lay behind her") merges well with Downing's some-
times eerie watercolors of the distraught parents, the girl alone in the woods, the
misshapen trolls. In her journey, the girl finds a use for all her treasures, including
her most prized possession, her red painted horse. The red mare grows and comes
to life in the magic of the forest and bravely offers to distract the trolls while the
girl rescues her ungrateful brother. The troll from "Three Billy Goats Gruff'
makes an appearance when he asks the girl "Who's that stamping on my bridge?"
A lonely feeling and magical mood are maintained throughout the story, and the
girl's love for her brother is matched only by the loyalty of the red mare. KJ

Beyond a vivid portrayal of the standard anxieties about grades, application to

adaptation to arid conditions. The book opens with a description of succulents'
mechanism for storing water and proceeds to elaborate on the development of
cacti, their differences from other plants, and the environments in which they
manage to survive. The contrasts speak impressively: "A medium-sized elm tree,
for example, may give off a ton of water in a single summer day" while "a column-

water." Carefully labeled diagrams clarify the explanations, as in the cross section

Feeding crows can control the populations of an insect called the corn borer and

Young Mirette, daughter of the Widow Gateau, helps her mother run a theatrical
boardinghouse in fin de sitcle Paris, where she meets the famous high-wire walker
Bellini. Bellini warns her that "once you start, your feet are never happy again on
the ground," but Mirette loves walking the tightrope; she grows so proficient un-
der Bellini's tutelage that she is able to save him and his performance when his
nerve fails during his big comeback. The illustrations are effectively reminiscent of
the period, with a lively Toulouse-Lautrec flavor in the scenes of Parisian life;
McCully uses some creative perspectives (Mirette, her mouth open with concen-
tration, seen from underneath the wire on which she balances) and a varied palette
that is most effective in the somber interiors and luminous night scenes, where
Mirette's orange hair shines out in contrast. She makes an enviable and plucky
heroine, darting among the theatrical crowd and doggedly practicing her difficult
skill; young readers will want to pull on their own high-button boots and join her
as she dances between the rooftops. DS

First published in 1968, this is the story of Finn, twelve, and his seven-year-old
sister Derval. Since the death of their Irish mother they've lived in England with
their unloving stepfather, Uncle Toby, but when his mistreatment proves too much
to bear, the children run away, intending to reach their grandmother in Ireland.
It's an old-fashioned melodramatic adventure and a good one, as the kids, with the
aid of lovable Irish rogues, rather stereotyped gypsies, and a sympathetic police-
man, keep one step ahead of Uncle Toby's attempt to retrieve them (he needs
them in order to receive a substantial inheritance). There's not much moral ambi-
guity here but there's plenty of action; the kids-against-the-odds story has a
Disneyesque flavor (the book was made into a movie, in fact, in 1972) enhanced
by the various colorful characters along the way, all of which helps make this a
good galloping read in a familiar and honorable tradition. DS

THE BULLETIN
or Carlstrom's Jesse Bear, What Will You Wear? Miller has dared to inject humor
into photography, which is often pretty but boring in picture books for very young
children. The full-color close-ups here will immediately engage listeners in a game
that can also reinforce their early attempts at order. "Where does Tavo put his
socks?" begins the first full-page question. "Among the flowers? On his nose? On
the dog's paw? In the wading pool?" ask the four funny pictures on the next page,
which, when you turn it to the verso, declares in boldface print across from a large
picture of a delighted little boy, "On his feet!" The ludicrousness of some of the
suggestions (ice cream on a sandal, book on a baby brother, doll between jars of
peanut butter and jelly, jacket in the refrigerator) will tickle kids at the same time
it gives them a sense of achievement that they know better than the book. With an
imaginative variation of subjects, races, and genders, this will invoke sensational
responses as a group readaloud (loud is the operative word here) or as a one-on-one
exchange. With some friendly persistence, it could even become a clean-up litany!

After twelve-year-old Jessie Harper's baby sister dies, their father withdraws into a
psychological depression so deep that no one can reach him, even though the
family is hard-pressed to survive the Depression in rural Oklahoma. Jessie and her
little brother help their mother as best they can, their only bright spot being a half-
wild dog named Ring, left behind by an aunt and uncle gone to pick crops in
California. Jessie has almost won the dog over when it's shot, and even her com-
passionate mother draws the line after the injured dog threatens her. It's too bad
that such a realistically detailed novel succumbs to a melodramatic ending, when,
in the last page and a half, Ring reappears to save Jessie from another wild dog and
Papa reappears to save Ring. Kids will love the excitement, however, and the
consistent quality of the sustained first-person narrative more than compensates
for a last bit of contrived action. BH

Buddy is a soulful-eyed yet smiling golden retriever, and he is the service dog of the
narrator, a boy of about ten whose muscular dystrophy has made it necessary for
him to use a wheelchair. In short and simple sentences the boy tells how he and
Buddy trained together after Buddy's two-year individual training, and how they
go to school, go shopping, and play with friends. It's a book about the partner-
ship, rather thanthe illness that has made it necessary, but there are some impor-
tant points subtly made about the narrator's similarities to the more physically
fortunate: he gets a haircut, takes a shower (with Buddy, at the training camp),
and sleeps stretched out in his bed with Buddy at his side. It's also made clear that
Buddy is not a pet: he wears A sign saying "Working dog--don't touch," and the
narrator says his mom "wanted to give Buddy a hug too, but she couldn't, because
he was working." Rand's watercolors are sunny but realistic, and both Buddy and
his master have a boyish appeal. As more service dogs appear in the community,
it's useful for kids to have an idea of what they do and how important they are, and
dog fanciers will love watching Buddy go through his paces. DS

Sent off to school with a treat of seven walnuts, John drops one which becomes the
delight of, successively, a squirrel, magpie, dormouse, and water rat, each of whom
treasures the nut until chased, sometimes caught, by something higher on the food
chain. It's a rather charming introduction to what seems, for most young chil-
dren, a brutal reality, and the walnut, if not its possessors, has a happy ending,
eluding all and growing into a fine tree. Watercolor illustrations are fine-lined and
bold, with a naturalistic precision that offsets the sometimes anthropomorphic tilt
of the text. Appended pages include a more detailed explanation of food chains,
explaining the feeding and predatory habits of the animals in the story, and con-
cludes with a recipe for walnut cake-tasty, if you can stop the kids from firmly
planting the nuts in the ground, safe from prey. RS

With a down-home storytelling style that enlivens his already flamboyant subject,
Porter treats Zora Neale Hurston' life as if it were one of her own best stories. In
describing Hurston's unhappy peripatetic adolescence, shunted among relatives,
rejected by her father, Porter writes, "still, Zora was a choosy beggar and as mouthy
as ever. Being needy didn't make her humble." Although it is for younger readers
than Mary Lyons' Sorrow's Kitchen: The Life and Folklore of Zora Neale Hurston
(BCCB 1/91), Porter's book captures all the complications and contradictions of
Hurston's character, her ornery refusal to kowtow to any authority, whether it was
the demands of a wealthy white patron or the chidings of the "respectable" black
literary establishment. Like the tales she collected in the South and the Caribbean,
Hurston's life is a hard thing to pin down on paper, but Porter goes a long way in
giving young readers a picture of someone who must have been just as hard to live
with as she was irresistible. Plenty of photos, notes, bibliography, and an index are
included. RS

While there was nothing really wrong with Suzanne Winckler's Antarctica, re-
viewed last month, it read like an encyclopedia article; in his book on the conti-
nent, Laurence Pringle shows-once again-a nose for interesting and telling detail.
To convey the immensity of some of the Antarctic's calved icebergs, for example,
he uses not an analogy, but a fact. "B-9 contained an estimated 287 cubic miles of
fresh water. That is enough to give everyone on earth two glasses of water a day for
1,977 years" (note, too, the precision: 1,977 is more convincing than "almost two
thousand"). Pringle's explanations of continental drift, the ozone layer, and the
greenhouse effect are clear and aptly placed; along with the discussion of natural
and physical phenomena, he describes the research techniques used by scientists to
understand the same. Color photos are numerous and neatly labeled; the format is
easy and open. A glossary and an index are appended. RS

"Did anyone ever stop to think about where this favorite snack came from?" Robbins
asks, and proceeds to outline briefly the genesis of peanut butter, bread, and milk.
He shows how peanuts progress from seeds-peanuts-to plants, through har-
vesting and shelling to grinding into butter; similarly concise explanations go for
the wheat-to-bread and cow-to-carton processes. (Interestingly enough, it appears
from Robbins' introductory note that he photographed at the smaller companies
because the big ones refused permission.) The text is quite informative despite its
brevity, although some descriptions are fuzzy ("The bushes grow stalks that bend
over and push back into the ground. .. new peanuts grow on the ends of these
stalks") and the thorough child will wonder where yeast, casually mentioned in the
bread section, comes from. Robbins' trademark hand-tinted photographs of agri-
culture and manufacturing are evocative in their own right, but combined with
the early-textbook typeface and the food symbols in the margins (a peanut for the
peanut butter section, a loaf for the bread, a cow for the milk, all in shades of
brown) the overall effect is rather stodgy. Even so, for a child looking for a simple
explanation of a favorite treat, this will be a pleasantly pastoral solution. DS

This suspenseful novel of eco-terrorism will probably find an audience among
adult Koontz and King fans as much as it will a YA readership, so we won't give
away the ending. A horribly discolored, mutilated dog corpse washes up on an
English beach, causing a huge secret government coverup ... but not before some-
one takes a picture of the corpse, and someone else realizes that this is no ordinary
dead dog. Three people-a classic 50's horror movie love triangle-become in-
volved: Mark, an impulsive lad willing to sacrifice everything to win back the girl
he loves; Derek Thorn, the idealistic young biochemistry professor whose feelings
for one student have gone beyond the pedagogical; and Sylvia, the brilliant, beau-
tiful, perfect young coed who spurs them both on. Although the book aspires to a
certain highmindedness concerning issues of animal rights and biological weap-
ons, it's actually pretty lowbrow, with a melodramatic quality that will be enjoyed
by the susceptible and cynical alike: "No other woman had ever meant more to
him than Sylvia did now. He needed her youth and her attitude. And he needed
to touch her. Even in the forensic lab, he could not resist it." But if the writing
isn't subtle, the story is taut in all the right places, the pace is terrific, and the
Andromeda Strain-like paranoia makes for spooky fun. RS

Marvin Redpost is, in his opinion, the Lost Prince of Shampoon. The evidence:
he's nine years old (the age the prince, kidnapped at birth, would now be), he's
left-handed (his teacher, also left-handed, says that means one has royal blood),
and his grandmother can't say which parent he looks like (he has red hair like the

King of Shampoon). This discovery brings thorny problems: are his parents-er,
Mr. and Mrs. Redpost-the kidnappers? If not, is the real Marvin Redpost dead?
What does he do about the money his royalty-struck classmates have begun to give
him? Mrs. Redpost generously agrees to take him to get his blood tested with
other potential lost potentates, and while he passes the first hurdle (right blood
type) he decides that his place is with the Redposts after all. The end is rather
abrupt, but the rest of the story is wonderfully logical and absurd, with a wit and
attention to detail rare in an easy reader. Sachar has a knack for quick but telling
characterization, and Marvin's charming family ("You are speaking to Prince Rob-
ert," Mrs. Redpost loyally declares to a hostile fellow prince-candidate) and faith-
ful friends add to the appeal. The illustrations are realistic, well-modulated pencil,
tonally unsuited to the broadly comedic story, but the text is quite lively enough to
keep the reader absorbed in Marvin's dynastic saga. DS

Fourteen-year-old Zarah is a flamboyantly creative dancer whose mother has shipped
her off from New York City for a summer's visit with her paternal grandmother,
Quanamina, on an isolated South Carolina island. Zarah confronts the challenge
of maintaining her African-American pride in face of white prejudice-and in face
of Quanamina's hidebound Gullah traditions, which involve both superstition
and strict religious observance, as well as rich historical memories. Finally, Zarah
must also face her grandmother's death and the responsibility for her five-year-old
cousin. This is an ambitious novel that succeeds on the strength of two unique
main characters. The sub-plot of Zarah's friendship with a white visitor her own
age seems strained, though it does add dramatic contrast to the plot. The setting
itself is developed with vivid detail. During the early stages of the novel, Seabrooke's
prose is occasionally overexplanatory: on one page, "'I can't be plain,' she said. 'I

Sender's previous memoirs The Cage (BCCB 11/86) and To Life recounted her
childhood and youth in the Lodz ghetto and in Auschwitz; the present book tells
of the author's experiences in America, visiting classrooms and writing to explain
to young people the reality of the Holocaust. Certainly, it is a story that needs to
be told; just as certainly, Sender has the moral authority to tell it. Unfortunately,
this book is so colored with a sense of self-aggrandizement that the truth the author
is attempting to tell becomes obscured behind the egocentricity of the teller. No
one, it seems, has ever quite moved readers or listeners to an understanding of the
Holocaust as has this author: "You are the living Anne Frank," says a Hebrew
school teacher to the author, just one of the many compliments Sender delivers to
herself via the words of others. You don't have to doubt that the man said this to
ask why the author feels the need to recount it. When a doctor acknowledges
Sender's stoic endurance of gallstones ("'Fourteen years.' He sighs. 'Half your life
you lived in pain'"), the supposed focus of the book becomes trivialized, calling the
reader's attention to the author's suffering and strength at the expense of the suffering
and strength experienced by those whom she means to commemorate. This is a
difficult book to criticize, challenging the reviewer's dictum that the book, not the
author, be the subject under review-but Sender has placed herself so far in front
that it is hard to see anything beyond her. RS

kitchen duties: ".... 
I checked the catsup, mustard and relish jars. I was also in
charge of straws and napkins." After work, his grandmother takes him out in a
boat to return his morning find, a "moonjelly," to its shimmering cousins in the
sea. Evening-lit pastel illustrations on heavily textured paper are sometimes ap-
pealingly naive and sometimes awkward, but varying perspectives and some keen
uses of contrasting colors (the warm ruddy glow of the ship's cabin, for instance,
that precedes the aquamarine palette of the moonjellies at sea) keep the pictures
moving. Kids will love seeing the important child in the thick of grownup work,
and the happy bustle of the nostalgically recreated food stand is an appetizing
milieu. The iridescent moonjellies (presumably some sort of phosphorescent jelly-
fish-a note of explanation for ignorant inland readers would have been useful)
add a serenely otherworldly touch to a cozy summery story. DS

life as the smallest and the youngest and the most loved." As Molly enters fifth

secretly begins to train for a track event to be held on the school athletic day.
Character and character dynamics are the important things in this book: Shreve
treats Molly's fear of change with tenderness and respect without evading the fact
that Molly has had it pretty easy until now. Molly's family have their own lives to
lead, but they're normal and loving and show up to cheer her on to victory; her
friends don't stop being her friends, but they do drift a bit, as does Molly. A good
example of a readable middle-grades book that doesn't go for a joke a minute, this
is a thoughtful and reassuring treatment of the kind of childhood social dynamics
that many adults dismiss and all kids experience. DS

did to educate children from farm-labor camps. Stanley's writing is sturdy but

Eleven-year-old Maria Gonzaga lives in a small town in California, where every
Christmas is celebrated with a parade of gorgeous and elaborate floats. No Mexican-
American family or business has ever entered a float in the parade, but Maria,
envious and tired of the prattlings of the Anglo girls about their families' floats
(" . . . hundreds of white and yellow mums, white and red roses, and hundreds of
poinsettias. Everything flowers. Everything. We're calling it 'Winter Garden,'"
gushes one of the girls) announces that her family too will be entering a float. Her
family is poor and her father strict, so although Maria succeeds in getting her
family entered, their meager funds keep them to a simple Nativity scene on an old
wooden wagon. In the parade, however, the biblical simplicity unsurprisingly
wins out over the gaudier entries, and "it was evident the humble had swept away
the grand." This is enough of a fable (it's set "many years ago") that the absence of
serious characterization isn't a problem, and Taylor doesn't make villains of the
rich folks in order to make heroes of the poor. The San Joaquin Valley location
makes for an unusual backdrop to this old-fashioned but still sweet true-meaning-

racist response to the young narrator's best friend, Kyra Kirk, who is black and
who moves in next door with her family. Christy, knowing Kyra from their youth
center, first notices her own mother's reluctance to invite Mrs. Kirk for coffee,
then worries about several kids' refusal to play with Kyra ("It's because I'm black,"
Kyra tells her), and finally is shocked when a block party turns ugly after the Kirks'
arrival ("What's next, firebombs?" asks Mr. Kirk after he finds his van with flat-
tened tires). Although this is clearly a story generated to address a problem, it is,
nevertheless, a story with well-defined action and two involving characters; the
purposeful doesn't become generic. Unframed watercolor illustrations are light
enough to balance the heavy theme without opting for any cute effects, and the
ending is both natural and hopeful-some of Christy's friends move away, but her
best friend, Kyra, stays. Just as natural and hopeful would be the inclusion of this

Mai, thirteen, and her family have to escape from Vietnam because her grand-
mother has come under suspicion of practicing folk medicine and "the old reli-
gion." The family-including the very reluctant grandmother-goes to the coastal
town of Go Cong, where they board a boat bound for Hong Kong, hoping even-
tually to get to America. Southeast Asian refugees have been the subject of several
novels for children, but this one has a rare simplicity and sharp focus. While the
book has the suspense and appeal of any good escape story, Whelan is neither
melodramatic nor sentimental, and the sometimes horrific details of the scary voy-
age are plain but understated. Mai is a credible and involving narrator; the charac-
terization of the grandmother is particularly fresh, with the crabby old woman
surprising everyone with her resourcefulness. The story ends with Mai's family on
their way to America; a sequel would be welcome but is by no means necessary.

"We get to the fields early, before it's even light. Sometimes I still be asleep. It be
cold, cold, cold." Thus begins an African-American child's description of a day
helping her family pick cotton. Shelan is not yet old enough to have her own sack,
but she piles up cotton for her mother, with a break for cornbread and greens at
lunchtime, till almost dark: "Us all be tired. Daddy take the baby; Mama take the
bundle. Me and Ruise, Jesmarie carry the sacks." The drama here is all in the
double-spread acrylic paintings, which make even the cotton seem action-packed,
the powerful body of the father projecting all the more motion. These are monu-
mentalized figures laboring against a deeply colored but sparely composed back-
ground. The time and place seem deliberately unspecified, though the temperature,
palm trees, and clothing make a contemporary California migrant scene more likely
than an Old South sharecropping situation. Whatever the case, it's a slice of life
that's presented without judgment or story, but the arresting art and brief text-
only two or three lines per page-will bring home an organic experience of work
that few children have known or even imagined. BH

After Annie's father dies, her boyfriend Jimmy virtually becomes her whole world:
her brothers are grown, her mother is long dead, and she's dropped out of high
school. Soon Annie is pregnant, and she denies the fact until it's too late for an
abortion. After connecting with an adoption agency and social worker, Annie
decides, with difficulty and regret but with Jimmy's support, to place the baby for
adoption. Annie's subdued and touching narration is conversationally colloquial
in style, and her confusion and ambivalence are realistically depicted. Wurmfeld,
who notes that the story comes from thinking about her own biological parents,
wisely avoids depicting any characters as bad guys or saints; Annie's older brother
is grieved but staunchly loyal, Jimmy's friends, an Outsiders-ish gang of sorts, re-
main close, and Annie herself is sad and a touch waif-like without being a down-
trodden victim. Novels depicting teen pregnancy usually don't deal so explicitly
with the placement process, and this readable book is especially perceptive about
the subtle day to day emotions of one important time in a young girl's life. DS

Based on a true story, this tells of one little boy's determination to save the one
remaining rain forest in his native Mexico. Omar has always dreamed about visit-
ing the Lacandon Rainforest, and when he hears on the news that the rainforest is
being gradually destroyed, he determines to do something about it. A letter to the
President accomplishes nothing, so Omar decides to walk to Chiapas-870 miles
away-and plead with the state governor. A suprise ally turns up in Omar's father,
who goes along on the walk. This picture book, originally published in Sweden
and illustrated with literal, sometimes naive watercolors, can't help but be didac-

tic; nevertheless, the cause, the father-and-son bond, and the pilgrimage will all
have great appeal for story hour crusaders. There's some confusion in a scene
where Omar visits a rainforest that does not appear to be the rainforest he means to
save; this could have been cleared up in the concluding note. As both the note and
the story indicate, neither Omar's walk nor a subsequent meeting with Mexico's
president stops the destruction of the forest, but his persistence is both admirable
and apparently indefatigable. RS
PROFESSIONAL CONNECTIONS
The genesis of a publishing trend can be mysterious in blending economic, social,
aesthetic, and accidental factors. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, federal
money to buy children's books converged with an active civil rights movement, an
artistic African-American renaissance, and some chance meetings between new
talents and newly aware editors to produce the first wave of children's literature
about the black experience. When money got tight and the country went conser-
vative, the wave diminished to a trickle, and for nearly a decade librarians and
teachers-fearing, perhaps, a return to the lily-white world of pre-sixties children's
literature-legitimately decried the lack of books by and about African Americans.
Now another high tide has surged with cyclical inevitability, partly due to new
educational markets opened up by the whole language movement, partly by the
sturdy efforts of a few determined creators and consumers, and partly by a public
preference for handsome picture books relying on brief poetic or folkloric texts.
All of these factors and more have contributed to an exciting new wave of
African-American, African, Caribbean, and black British picture books for children.
Of course, there's the usual backwash of titles more trendy than trend-setting, and
both parents and professionals need to bear in mind that political correctness is no
substitute for good storytelling and story art. (I recently overheard a book discussion
group praise a book for the sole qualification that it was "multi-cultural.") The
importance of the African-American experience does not make black nostalgia any
better than white, when nostalgia is used as a substitute for plot. One of the
brutally honest ways of wading through this trend is to ask whether the story or art
would be considered strong enough to sustain the book-and energetic young
listeners' attention-if it were about middle-class white kids.
Happily, the answer is yes in many cases of recent picture book literature
(as well as fiction for older readers, as we shall see in The Big Picture of an upcom-

ing issue). A random sampling in the September and October issues of The Bulle-
tin includes Mary Hoffman's Amazing Grace, Virginia Hamilton's Drylongso, Lloyd
Alexander's The Fortune Tellers, Donald Crews' Shortcut, Mary-Joan Gerson's
Why the Sky is Far Away, Sherley Anne Williams' Working Cotton, Judith Vigna's
Black Like Kyra, White Like Me, and Ashley Bryan's Sing to the Sun. Some of
these are written by black writers, some by white; some are illustrated by black
artists, some by white; some are by "mixed" teams; the color of a creator is touchy
stuff in the U.S. The question of whether whites can write about blacks and vice
versa is too complicated for the scope of this column, but carried to extremes, it
leads to the question of whether any human being can write about another. Is
Trina Schart Hyman, who is white and whose grandson is half African, qualified
to paint a story about Cameroon, where she has traveled extensively? Fortunately,
people are more complex than the politics that separate them. People fall in love,
and their colors get mixed up; or they learn to love, and their colors enhance each
other. There's no better way to start that process than with stories: reading aloud,
booktalking, and storytelling in a library or classroom. Multicultural literacy starts
with the selective acquisition and imaginative use of the multicultural array of
books you see reviewed.
Betsy Hearne, Editor
We have recently received two new multicultural resources for teachers and librar-
ians. Margaret Read MacDonald has compiled Peace Tales: World Folktales to
Talk About, a collection of thirty-four tales with themes of conflict and peace,
argument and community. The publisher is Linnet/Shoe String; the hardcover
edition is $22.50 (ISBN 0-208-02328-3), the paperback is $13.95 (ISBN 0-208-
02329-1). The retellings are crisp; notes and suggestions for telling are appended;
a multicultural index gives access to the stories. 116p.
The New York Public Library Office of Young Adult Services offers Global Beat:
A List of Multi-Cultural Books for Teenagers. The thirty-four page pamphlet is
organized by regions("India and Pakistan," "Africa, South of the Sahara"), and is
annotated with an eye toward teenaged browsers. Copies are $5.00 dollars each
with a mailing charge of $1.00. Order from the Office of Branch Libraries, The
New York Public Library, 455 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10016.

SUBJECT AND USE INDEX
Keyed to The Bulletin's alphabetical arrangement by author, this new index, which
will appear in each issue, can be used in three ways. Entries in regular type refer to
subjects; entries in bold type refer to curricular or other uses; entries in ALL-
CAPS refer to genres and appeals. In no way meant to be a cataloging aid, this
rather idiosyncratic index is instead intended to lead readers to those books re-
viewed that could fill a particular gap in a collection; to help teachers and librarians
find books that might be useful in various school or recreational settings; and to
help in those requests for a "love story" or a "scary story." In the case of subject
headings, the subhead "stories" refers to books for the readaloud audience; "fic-
tion," to those books intended for independent reading. Although subscriber re-
sponse to The Bulletin 's format, features, and reviews is always welcome, we would
especially like to hear your comments about the usefulness of this new index and
your advice for ways it could be expanded or improved. Please direct your sugges-
tions to executive editor Roger Sutton at the editorial office address found on page
32.

feel after being abandoned by their parents? Challenging Bruno Bettelheim

"As a teenager in Kaposvar, Hungary, the author dreamed of studying litera-
ture at the Sorbonne. At age 19, her reality was forced labor in the notorious
camp of Auschwitz. Her memoir of that experience is a testament to the
reilince of the human spirit, kept alive, as her own was, through humor
and creativity. Isaacson tells of evading selection by the feared Dr. Mengele
for transport with other young women to the Russian front; of her transfer to
Lichtenau; and, after the Allied liberation, meeting the American intelligence
offer who became her husband. Based on indelible recollections, a return
trip to Hungary and research into the Hungarian Holocaust, this is an
eloquent picture of a life before and after." - P/Wshers Wak y
