Doll Bones 
by Holly Black; illustrated by Eliza Wheeler
The shadowy threshold that lies between the fancies of childhood and the realities 
of the adult world can be awfully difficult to navigate, and that’s precisely where 
best friends Zach, Poppy, and Alice find themselves as they make their way through 
middle school. For years now, their friendship has centered on “the game,” a role-
playing fantasy in which the three pals bring out their best action figures and dolls 
and pretend to be various heroes and villains going on glorious adventures. Their 
fun abruptly comes to a halt when Zach’s father throws his dolls in the trash and 
informs him that it’s time to grow up; though furious, Zach feels his father may be 
right and ignores his friends’ pleas to return to the game. Poppy won’t give up so 
easily, however, and convinces Zach to join her and Alice on a last mission: one of 
her dolls has been visiting Poppy in her dreams, and Poppy believes the doll holds 
the spirit of a murdered girl who must be put to rest. 
Black manages a careful balancing act of reality and fantasy, using the 
effectively creepy ghost story as the backdrop to a poignant exploration of what is 
lost along the way to adulthood. The dreamlike quality of the fantastical journey 
the kids undergo, pirating a dinghy on a local river and indulging in sweets-only 
meals, is superimposed against the urban decay of an economically depressed town, 
reminding readers that not all stories, especially in the real world, have happy end-
ings. Indeed, reality can be quite painful for our heroes: Zach’s rage at his father 
comes as much from his father’s prolonged absence and sudden reappearance as 
his trashing of Zach’s dolls; Poppy’s exhausted parents barely notice her among her 
raft of siblings; Alice struggles to please her overbearing grandmother. The game 
offers each of them a refuge, and when Zach’s plan to quit and deprive the game 
of its hero alters the landscape of their pretend world, it’s not so much the magic 
of that place that the friends fear losing but its safety. 
The threat that their looming adulthood carries is apparent in the story of 
Eleanor, the girl whose ghost who may be inhabiting the doll they call the Queen. 
It’s never quite clear if the ghost is real or merely another product of Poppy’s imagi-
nation, and the ambiguity creates a sinister and slightly disorienting air. The real 
Eleanor’s death as an adolescent, murdered at the hands of an unpredictable force, 
is a childhood fear come to fruition: that bad things can and do happen in ways 
that defy the safe conventions of storytelling. The efforts of Zach, Poppy, and Alice 
to set things right for Eleanor therefore feel wonderfully, if a bit hopelessly, naïve, 
lacing the bravery of their quest with a touch of melancholy.
The emotional journey is as satisfying as the actual adventure: the afore-
mentioned pirating of small boats, along with midnight bus trips, narrow escapes

from well-intentioned librarians, and graveyard searches will keep readers turning 
the pages, even the tweens who yet experienced the sturm und drang of adolescence. 
Those readers who have weathered the storm, however, and who are mourning 
the world they once inhabited will find a kindred spirit in Poppy, whose lament, 
“I hate that everyone calls it growing up, but it seems like dying,” is keenly felt by 
nostalgics everywhere. (See p. 454 for publication information.)

Almond, dAvid Mouse Bird Snake Wolf; illus. by Dave McKean. Candlewick, 
2013 80p
ISBN 978-0-7636-5912-7 $17.99   
R Gr. 4-6
In this graphic fable, author Almond and illustrator McKean imagine a world 
much like our own, but with curious gaps and empty spaces left when its creators 
decided to take a rest. Harry, Sue, and Little Ben enjoy the wonders of this world, 
but they are intrigued—half scared, half curious—by its empty places as well. 
While the self-satisfied gods sit around congratulating each other on their many 
accomplishments and eventually fall asleep, the children imagine how to supply 
what they think is lacking. Ben conceives of a mouse, Susan a bird, and Harry a 
snake, crafting them out of found materials and then willing them to life. When 
Susan and Harry create a wolf, which immediately devours them, Ben frantically 
unmakes the animal and rescues them, but the wolf that they were once inside of 
now lives inside Susan and Harry. The gods then awaken, full of dreams and plans 
inspired by the children’s creations, both benign and terrible. Like all good fables, 
this one has multiple interpretive possibilities and moral resonances, in addition to 
being a compelling story in its own right. McKean’s illustrations effectively comple-
ment Almond’s textual world-making, employing a taupey monochromatism for 
the gods and a color palette that relies on troubled olive and piercing chartreuse 
for the children. He creates labile faces and body parts through lines that seem to 
writhe and move on the page, conveying the children’s shifting emotions during their 
creative processes from puzzlement to imaginative spark, from wonder and delight 
to apprehension and horror; each of the heavy-lidded gods has a distinct personality 
effected through body shape and expression. There are various ways of looking at 
the relationship between creator and creation as both children and gods consider 
the wisdom and consequences of the things they have made. Much rich fodder 
for the discussion of big ideas as well as storytelling form will be found here.  KC

Reviewed from galleys   
R Gr. 6-8
Da’s increasingly violent outbursts frighten his fourteen-year-old son, Stanley, and 
when Da appears to have made good on his threat to drown Soldier, Stanley’s pup, 
the boy clears out. Lying about his age, Stanley joins the British Army, already 
engaged in the Great War, and he ends up the War Dog School, training dogs as 
battle messengers. Bones, a big lug of a Great Dane, is assigned to Stanley and the 
two forge a deep bond, making the dog’s heroic death in battle devastating for the 
boy. A heartbroken Stanley initially resists his next assignment, Pistol, a mangy 
dog with serious trust issues, but he soon comes to love Pistol as well, especially 
after he learns that Pistol is actually Soldier, who was never drowned in the first 
place but given to the Army. When the line falls apart and Tom’s company is 
surrounded by the Germans, Stanley has to make the difficult decision to send 
Pistol/Soldier into battle in order to allow the company to send a message about 
the enemy’s precise position. This is a fascinating slice of World War I history, and 
readers who like fiction about war, history, or dogs will find much to enjoy here. 
Although the situation is admittedly contrived, the story is genuinely compelling, 
the war descriptions are realistic without being horribly graphic, and Soldier’s 
risky messenger run is absolutely gripping (“Stanley could think of nothing, hear 
nothing, see nothing, only that mercury thread, only the grey form that skimmed 
the ground like a rushing shadow”). A historical note and photos of real war dogs, 
author’s note, and bibliography are included. This would make a great partner for 
Morpurgo’s War Horse, and kids who join up with Stanley and Soldier are in for a 
similarly heart-wrenching adventure.  JH

Fourteen is a difficult age in general, and it’s particularly tough for Cameron, who 
has schizophreniform disorder, which means that when he’s not on his meds, voices 
in his head speak to him. The problem is that he doesn’t like feeling like a patient 
and he actually enjoys the company of the voices—he appreciates The Professor’s 
kindly wisdom, and he’s thrilled that The Girl, who’s new, finds Cameron attrac-
tive. He’s therefore secretly skipping his meds and getting more smitten with The 
Girl; confusingly, he’s also growing closer with Nina, a classmate in his emotionally 
disturbed program who is straightforward and unjudging of his voices and shares 
his wish for more independence. Meanwhile, an aggressive new voice that Cam-
eron calls The Other Guy is pushing Cameron toward behaviors that he begins 
to realize are downright dangerous. Cameron’s narration brings the fundamental 
teenage question—“It’s my own life I have to live. Don’t I get to choose?”—into 
sharp relief in a situation where stakes are clearly very high, and the book explores 
the issues without resorting to any pat answers. In fact, Cameron’s growing rebellion 
is wisely treated as developmentally appropriate at heart; additionally, the pull of 
the voices (each in a different font) is understandable, so he’s a deeply sympathetic 
character overall.  The accessible writing makes Cameron and his struggle vivid to 
young readers, and they’ll find this an eye-opening walk in somebody else’s shoes. 
An afterword briefly describes schizophreniform disorder.  DS

Berne, Jennifer On a Beam of Light: A Story of Albert Einstein; illus. by Vladimir 
Radunsky. Chronicle, 2013 52p
ISBN 978-0-8118-7235-5 $17.99   
Ad 5-8 yrs
“Little Albert was so different; was there something wrong?” It’s understandable 
that Albert Einstein’s parents would be more inclined to worry about a child who 
barely talked at three than to predict he would become a game-changing physicist. 
Here Berne offers a bare bones outline of Einstein’s journey from wonder-struck 
child to world-renowned genius, emphasizing for a young audience that his ec-
centric work habits belied his intellectual prowess. The actual content of Einstein’s 
work, however, is condensed to little more than suggestion: “Albert thought about 
very, very big things. Like the size and shape of the entire universe. He thought 
about very, very small things. Like what goes on inside the atoms that everything 
is made of.” The substance of the subject is wispy, but the visual presentation is 
utterly charming. Wiry ink outlines dabbed with watercolor fill portray the great 
man in affectionate caricature, and slightly oversized font parceled sparingly against 
grainy, unbleached paper background results in an exceptionally warm, clean 
layout. While this title is unlikely to advance primary-schoolers’ understanding 
of quantum physics, it should at least nurture name recognition and perhaps lure 
readers into Don Brown’s weightier picture book Odd Boy Out (BCCB 10/04) a 
year or two down the road.  EB

In this title first published as four separate volumes in a series, blonde, cheerful Lucy 
and dark-haired, broody Soledad have been best friends since birth, with Lucy’s 
bravery balancing Soli’s more timid nature as they explore the woods behind their 
house. Lucy’s mother has warned them that the forest is home to faeries and they 
should never make a wish when they are there, but the girls don’t really believe 
her. When Soli gets her first crush, she asks Lucy to speak to the boy on her behalf, 
and the inevitable happens: Jaleel kisses Lucy instead of Soli, and Lucy likes it even 
though she hates betraying her friend. When it happens again, the girls argue in 
the woods, and Soli wishes Lucy were gone, whereupon her friend disappears. 
Lucy’s mom tells a regretful Soli how to go to the faerieground to reclaim Lucy and 
gives her a talisman for protection, and what Soli and Lucy find in faerieland is a 
surprise that will change everything. Spare, lyrical narration alternates perspective 
between the two girls, establishing a melancholy tone for Soli and a more prag-
matic voice for Lucy as the girls find themselves immersed in a world where their 
everyday problems seem petty and their self-images are shaken. As important to 
the storytelling, though, are the striking and richly atmospheric full-page illustra-

tions that resonate somewhere between hyper-beautiful fantasy and apprehensive 
fear. Digitally enhanced photorealistic renderings of the girls, the woods, and the 
faeriefolk who live there possess a dreamlike quality in their play of light, shadow 
and texture across fully saturated colors. The plot itself has enough archetypal 
qualities to feel both familiar and hauntingly strange at the same time, especially 
for middle-schoolers; lovers of fantasy art and readers who still want to believe in

Ad 5-7 yrs
Mary, “a good, polite little girl who always spoke in a small, soft voice,” heads 
out on the bus with her mother to buy a toy for her little brother’s birthday. In 
the crowded toy store, soft-spoken Mary is drowned out, and since her mother 
is focused on talking to a friend, there’s no one to help Mary get to the toys she’s 
trying to purchase. Fortunately, Mary finally manages to speak up so she’s actually 
heard and scores a lovely blue elephant just right for Mary’s little bro. The book is 
somewhat misleading about what’s actually polite and what is merely self-effacing, 
so it’s a little confusing as a manners lesson; the message that you need to speak up 
for what you want is an good one, though, and the stressful depiction of Mary’s re-
peatedly getting beaten to the punch will wring anxious sympathy from kids who’ve 
definitely been there. Vibrant full-bleed pastel illustrations, usefully punctuated 
with occasional vignettes, emphasize reds, russets, and earthtones. The rich color 
tends to overwhelm the compositions, making them somewhat undifferentiated, 
but Mary’s big round head and wavy blonde locks usually makes her findable amid 
the tumult, and she’s endearing in her shy sweetness. Even loudmouth kids may 
relate to the problem of being overshadowed by adults at times, and they’ll be glad 
to see Mary take her stand.  DS

A little green duck can’t find his special new blue socks: “I know I put them 
somewhere near./ How could they simply disappear?” He asks his friends the fox, 
the ox, and finally the peacocks, one of whom notices that “I can see a touch of 
blue/ underneath your laced-up shoe!” Yes, the duck was wearing them all along, 
and he rejoices in his reunion with his beloved blue socks. The sonorous, Seussian  
cadence of Bunting’s rhyming text lends itself to reading aloud, but older beginning 
readers up to a few challenging vocabulary words might also successfully tackle 
this on their own, especially once they’ve heard it read a few times. Ruzzier’s pen 
and ink and watercolor illustrations keep the mood calm with soothing, subdued 
shades of blue, green, and yellow predominating, and the small green duck is a 
sympathetic little guy as he dejectedly searches for his socks in his pinkish-brown 
oxford shoes, one of which is untied for much of the book. Small, well-chosen 
details add further interest to the backdrops, as in the duck’s search through a box 
that produces a starfish, a soccer ball, and a pair of underpants, but no socks; or in 
the presumed baby portrait—of an egg—sitting on his bookcase. Young children 
with strong attachments to particular garments will easily relate to the duck’s need

An international move to a small village outside Oxford turns into a marvelous 
adventure for eleven-year-old Holly Shepard when a mysterious key, given to her 
by a kindly neighbor, unlocks a magical door in a tree deep in a forest glade. No 
sooner has she stepped into the strange other world, followed by her nerdy younger 
brother Ben and their nosy neighbor Everett, than the boys are taken captive at 
sword-point, while Holly is rescued by a centaur and taken to the hideout of the 
country’s magical exiles. There she learns that she is an Adept, the first wand-
wielder to be seen in Anglielle in generations. To rescue the boys, she must harness 
her powers, quest for a new wand, and convince the country’s magical forces to 
unite behind her. As the three children struggle to be reunited and find their way 
home, their way is threatened by a maniacal king, an evil sorcerer, and Everett’s 
own dangerous secret. A fun-filled read, this lengthy but fast-moving novel is a 
solid fantasy in the classic tradition. The multi-threaded narrative offers a variety of 
young heroes for readers to root for, and it’s jam-packed with memorable secondary 
characters of the magical sort, like sleek leogryffs, tricky fairies, and a talking cat. 
The writing is likely to be a strong draw, as readers who love language play will 
revel in the archaic-lite speech of Anglielle. A prophecy of war, Holly’s blood oath, 
and the children’s failure to thwart the sorcerer entirely before escaping home set 
up the possibility for future sequels.  AM

Every four years, two children are kidnapped from the small town of Galvaldon, 
appearing shortly thereafter as characters in the town’s storybooks, one child as a 
hero, the other a villain. Sophie is determined to get kidnapped this year and make 
her way to the School of Good, where a girl as princess-like as herself belongs. She 
does indeed get stolen away by the School Master, but so does her reluctant friend 
Agatha, a grumpty, sarcastic girl rumored to already be a witch. When the two 
arrive at the Schools, however, it’s Aggie who joins the princess ranks and Sophie 
who is cast down with the other wart-nosed villains in the School of Evil. Undoing 
what both girls believe to be a mistake by the school administration proves to be 
difficult, and soon Aggie is charming a prince, Sophie is leading a coven, and their 
friendship is falling apart. A backstory about the town’s curse and the school’s history 
becomes a little complicated, but the primary focus remains on the two girls and 
their efforts to sustain their relationship even as their circumstances and their own 
personalities change. As the villainess who thinks she is good, Sophie is hilariously

Shunned by the others in his Inuit village, orphaned boy Ava is surprised to find 
himself warmly welcomed by the Inugarulligaarjuit, the magical little people he 
meets one day in the Arctic wilderness. They invite him to stay, but Ava knows, 
sadly, that he’s much too big to fit through the door of their home. A group hunt-
ing trip leads to an eventual change of perspective for Ava, and he finds that after 
“learning to see things in new ways” he can in fact fit into the rock house, and he is 
happily adopted by a kind Inugarulligaarjuit family. The storytelling here is carefully 
polished and thoroughly engaging, and the glimpse into Inuit life and folklore is 
fascinating. Orphaned and mistreated Ava is a sympathetic figure, and there is great 
satisfaction in seeing him find a loving home with the magical, warm-hearted little 
people, who are clearly kin to the Western version of elves and leprechauns. While 
small print may make this a challenge to share with a group, Wright’s watercolor 
illustrations will engage viewers: pale browns and grays contrast with lots of white 
space to effectively capture the windy cold of the icy white Arctic setting, and the 
ruddy-nosed, stylized figures of Ava and the Inugarulligaarjuit are detailed and 
expressive. An introduction by Christopher gives some folkloric background for 
the story, and a list of character names (with meanings and pronunciations) and a 
glossary are also provided.  JH

and not just any scientist but one who possessed a Timekey. Riley makes it through

now Garrick has all the cunning from past career as an illusionist, all the darkness

Sounds like the kind of evil guy who’d use his attributes to rule the world, and it’s

heroes are a likable pair and a canny tag team, but it’s the villains who shine in this

Spending three months with his grandmother on a small New England island 
will give high school senior Noah a chance to complete a dream internship with 
the island’s famed marine biologist; additionally, Noah’s sister Lo might finally be 
able to get her bulimia under control away from the gaze of her critical father. The 
island and their grandmother, Gemm, turn out to hold surprising secrets: there’s a 
family of selkies off the coast, and its matriarch has long been romantically involved 
with their grandmother. Noah finds himself drawn to Mara, one of the selkie girls, 
as well, but when one of the seal creatures goes missing at the hands of a human 
fisherman, Noah’s romance, Lo’s friendship, and Gemm’s lifelong relationship with 
the selkies are threatened. Any one of the multiple story threads could have been 
massively overplayed, but Cornwell has a deft hand with her characterizations, 
and the shifting focalizations among Noah, Lo, Gemm, Mara, and the kidnapped 
selkies manage to continually move the plot forward even while focusing on their 
emotional pain. The parallels between the two families are unmistakable: the eldest 
siblings are caught between their family obligations and their own hopes for the 
future, two sisters are left scarred by abuse, and both elders are haunted by their 
past mistakes and insistent, sometimes forcefully so, that their young ones don’t 
repeat their history of secrets. A satisfying mix of folktale, mystery, and family 
drama, this eerie story will leave readers with the distinct impression that Gemm’s 
island home has a bottomless supply of heartbreaking tales of love and loss.  KQG

Jesse has read every book on his teacher’s shelf, and his only opportunity for fresh 
material presents when the R. Edwards canal boat library and bookstore floats 
into his nearby town. Pa lets him explore Mr. Edwards’ offerings while he gets 
the shovel handle repaired, and Jesse sets his heart on a hardly used edition of The 
Swiss Family Robinson. At the princely sum of twenty cents, it’s out of his financial

enough time to take on odd jobs to earn the price of the book. Sweeping at the

New York City is supposed to offer a fresh start for sixteen-year-old Elizabeth 
and her family, who are fleeing the small-town life that got Elizabeth’s younger 
brother, Laurie, severely beaten for being gay. Stephen, also sixteen, happens to 
live in their new building, but no one knows it—since birth, Stephen has been 
invisible due to a curse put upon him by his own grandfather. Elizabeth, however, 
can see Stephen, and the two fall into a relationship after just a few days. How-
ever, this isn’t a fairy tale that’s resolved by true love’s kiss: Elizabeth’s connection 
with Stephen draws both her and Laurie deeper into a world of cursecasters and 
spellseekers until a confrontation with Stephen’s grandfather leaves Elizabeth close 
to death. The dialogue requires as much suspension of disbelief as the invisibility 
element—these teens inhabit the world of John Green and Gilmore Girls, firing 
off pop culture reference and preternaturally wise statements of philosophy in a 
moment’s notice. The characters are also so effortlessly likable, though, that their 
precocity is mostly endearing. The authors bypass the conventional obstacles to 
Elizabeth and Stephen’s inevitable romance and instead focus on the development 
of their relationship as the circumstances around them change. The curse and the 
invisibility add tension to their plight, but these teens are dealing with the issues 
any relationship encounters: the ebb and flow of intimacies, their insecurities and 
doubt, the realization that love is not simply a feeling but a sustained effort with 
no guarantees. Stephen and Elizabeth alternate narration, but Laurie is perhaps the 
most compelling one here, rising above the happy-go lucky gay sidekick to become 
a complex and essential part of the story. The fairy-tale circumstances tempered by 
real-world emotions will hold major appeal for teens looking for both drama and 
a mostly happy ending.  KQG

Among the wonders collected by naturalist Charles Darwin on his famed voyage 
aboard the Beagle is a creature that’s kept scientists guessing since the mid-nineteenth 
century. It’s not just Rhinoderma darwinii’s Pinocchio-like snout, or its variety of skin 
colors, or its teeny inch-long size, but rather its outré breeding habits. The female 
frog contributes the customary clutch of eggs for fertilization, but then the male 
takes over by brooding the newly hatched tadpoles in his vocal sacs and “burping” 
them loose a couple of weeks later as fingernail-sized baby frogs. Crump, who has 
herself studied the frogs and written about them for the academic community, 
focuses not only on the oddities of the frogs, but also on early misunderstandings 
of their physiology (the presence of tadpoles within a frog’s body once led scientists 
to believe the brooders were female) and even the broader scientific shift from

merely describing species to actually investigating their behavior. Illustrations here 
represent the best of two worlds—clear photography allows readers to examine the 
animals in natural settings, while scientific rendering, in this case not Audubon-

somewhat cramped typeface makes this offering appear a bit daunting, but read-

concepts accessible. End matter is substantive and thoughtfully arranged, from the

Paulie loves his girlfriend Hannah, but that doesn’t mean he can resist his inclina-
tions when Mary all but insists that they have sex one night. Riddled with guilt, 
Paulie confesses to Hannah, ruining the most intense relationship he’s ever had. 
He confides all of his frustrations to his close-to-retirement teacher and swimming 
partner, Logs, who runs a no-holds-barred lunchtime discussion group called Period 
8. Here the constellation of high school characters in the small northwestern town 
hold forth on issues such as honesty in relationships and the inability of teens to 
make good decisions due to immature brain development. One of the guys, however, 
is a real snake, but Paulie and the others don’t realize the depths of his sociopathic 
behavior until it’s too late. This has all of the elements readers have come to ex-
pect in a Crutcher novel: empathetic teens trying to survive under the thumbs of 
damaged and damaging adults; a would-be savior and sage, haunted by his own 
past but doing his darnedest to help the kids; and dialogue that expresses preter-
naturally self-aware psychological insight in gritty, hipster slang. These elements 
make Crutcher a taste call even when his construction is solid, but the plotting and 
character development falter here. Abrupt shifts in focalization deliver insight into 
most of the main characters’ motivations, but the villain is left flatly cartoonish, 
the victims are all but voiceless, and the structure of the crime is ambiguous even 
when readers understand it has something to do with underage prostitution. That 
said, there is lots of material for follow-up here in the characters’ discussions about 
responsibility and the suggestion that too much pressure and control at home makes 
teens vulnerable to abuse elsewhere. Given the foregrounding of relationship issues 
and the action-packed, suspenseful climax, readers will come for the plot and stay 
for the psychological insight.  KC

Despite the title, it’s initially only Peanut who has an actual ball, and the little girl 
is delighted with her new toy (“It was bright blue. And it was special”). Her sister, 
pigtailed Fifi, yearns for a piece of the action, but grabbing for the ball, begging, 
and suggesting shared games don’t melt Peanut’s resolve to hang on to her toy. 
Finally Fifi gets wise and presents an attraction all her own: a seal named Bob, and 
a planned trip around the world for Bob, Fifi, Peanut, and the ball. The back-and-
forth rhythm between Peanut and Fifi (one resisting, the other pushing) is brisk,

and their exchanges are funny as Fifi grows ever more creative in her attempts to 
make Peanut share her treasure. The story spirals into confusion, however, with 
the arrival of Bob the seal, and a fakeout ending stops the momentum in its tracks. 
Additionally, Peanut’s sudden yearning to play with Fifi is a bit puzzling, since 
it’s never made clear why this pretend game is any more inviting than the oth-
ers. Schmidt’s art makes the sisters into an adorable pair: strongly graphic digital 
images involving smooth, thick black outlines and a few slightly smoky planes of 
color contrast with the ivory backgrounds, and the girls’ poses differentiate them 
as clearly as their clothing and hair. Kids know both the desire to grab and the 
desire to withhold, so they’ll relate to both the sisters and have similar tales to tell 
of their own sharing dramas.  DS

In this retelling of a Bengali tale, Grandma leaves her two faithful dogs, Kalu and 
Bhulu, to tend her garden while she goes to visit her daughter on the other side of 
the jungle. On her way there she encounters a hungry fox, bear, and tiger, all of 
whom want to eat her on the spot; she successfully convinces each of them to wait 
until she returns from her stay with her daughter, arguing that she will be fatter 
and juicier then since her daughter is such an exceptional cook. When the time 
comes for Grandma to return, she and her daughter hollow out a giant gourd and 
seal Grandma up in it so that she can roll home in disguise. The tiger and bear 
are fooled by this ruse, but not the clever fox, who rips open the sealed gourd and 
discovers Grandma within. Canny Grandma calls to her dogs to come to her aid, 
and Kalu and Bhulu rush to Grandma and chase away the fox; Grandma and her 
canine saviors then celebrate with a pot of delicious khichuri. Divakaruni gives no 
notes for this tale, other than stating it was told to her by her grandfather, but the 
story itself is engaging and tautly constructed. The frequent use of sound-effect 
words (“Quick as wind, hoosh-hoosh, they flew into the forest”) and repeated turns 
of phrase make this especially pleasurable to read aloud, while the simple vocabulary 
will also put this within the abilities of many upper primary readers. Waters’ lively 
illustrations have the rich texture of digital collage, and while the vividly hued ele-
ments make compositions busy a times, the individual components are attractive 
and eye-catching. Dog owners will especially appreciate this story, as will those who 
simply enjoy a well-told folktale.  JH

A group of frogs are surprised to find a small, pink pig perched in their pond, and 
even more surprised when the pig exclaims, “Ribbit!” “‘WHAT did he say?’ cried 
the frogs. ‘This pig is confused!’ ‘Does he think he’s a frog?’ ‘Is he making fun of 
us?’” The frogs work themselves into a frenzy over their visitor and decide, along 
with the rest of the local fauna, to go consult the wise old beetle, who suggests that 
the pig just wants to make new friends. Chastened by this thought, the frogs and 
other animals cheerfully join the pig a bit later when they spy him “tweeting” in 
a nearby tree. Although the story is rather slight, the hospitality message is a good 
one and the dialogue is pithily droll: “‘Why would a pig want to be a frog?’ said the 
parrot. ‘And what is wrong with being a frog, may we ask?’ exclaimed the frogs.” 
Bernatene’s illustrations are boldly composed, with the amiable pig often featured 
front and center or to one side, while the slender-limbed frogs loll disgruntledly 
about the edges. The bright pink porker offers a pleasing contrast to the more 
natural green, brown, gray, and blue tones brushily applied to the subtly textured 
background of the pond-area animals and the surrounding landscape. The crabby-
looking frogs (especially the one with wonky eyeballs and permanently protruding 
tongue) are particularly funny in their pop-eyed disbelief. Kids will be amused by 
the pig’s unusual vocalizations, and this could easily hop its way into either frog- or 
pig-themed storytimes.  JH

In this wordless picture book, a family in a red pickup truck heads home through 
farm country at the leading edge of a storm front. Animals scurry into their 
burrows for shelter just as lightning downs a power line and the family makes a 
quick stop to unload hay bales with a neighbor. With the wind and rain at their 
backs, the family hits the road, but an overheated engine forces them into another 
neighbor’s shed for quick repair work. The next leg of their trek is cut short by 
blackening skies and howling wind, and they shelter beneath the arch of a stone 
underpass, while a twister rips through the area and demolishes a farmhouse. Yet 
another neighbor is in need of help, and the last of their hay bales serve as tables 
and benches for the crew of volunteers who show up to stabilize the fresh wreck-
age.  After their six-hour trip, indicated by the time given at the bottom of each 
page, the family finally arrives home under a sky so blue and clear that it’s hard to 
believe nature had just caused such a destructive ruckus. This is a tightly focused 
examination of Man facing off with Nature, and Geisert’s signature deployment 
of minutiae is strictly in the service of documenting the mind-boggling flurry of 
activity that accompanies a typical Midwestern weather event (his signature pigs, 
along with a host of other animals, appear as they hunker down before the storm).

when Bean Dog’s shiny new ball rolls into the big, scary bushes, and the two friends 
transform into Superdog and Ninja Nugget to retrieve their toy. In The Cookie, 
they argue over who gets the biggest half of the last cookie after a game of playing 
with an invisible donut leaves them hungry. Sequential paneling and uncluttered 
white backgrounds (touched occasionally grays and muted pinks) make the action 
easy to follow. The story is told entirely through Bean Dog and Nugget’s dialogue, 
with plenty of repetitive vocabulary to build up the confidence of young readers,

book bristles with appealing humor, between the mustache itself and the artistic 
interpretations of Billy’s doings, and audiences will appreciate the underlying ac-
ceptance of Billy at his worst as well as best. The art, smoothly textured, opaque 
digital tones that suggest acrylic, is at times overcartoony, but big-headed Billy is 
an adorable Fisher-Price cowboy/villain. Make the kid-friendly joke even better 
by doling out paper cookie-dusters so the crowd can mustache up with Billy—it’s

Ti-Anna’s father, a Chinese pro-democracy activist, has taken political refuge in the 
United States with his family, but he leaves suddenly for Hong Kong one day and 
soon thereafter drops out of contact with his daughter and wife. Accompanied by 
classmate Ethan and financed by his absent mother’s credit card, Ti-Anna flies to 
Hong Kong to catch the scent of her father’s trail. A wealthy businessman friend 
of her father gives the teens their first tip, leading them initially to a reclusive 
journalist and then on to a late-night meeting in a walled house, where Ti-Anna is 
abducted by human traffickers. Ethan orchestrates her rescue, and the pair tracks

On the distant planet of Sekoia, seventeen-year-old Lissa Ivory is shocked to find 
that her strange visions are actually a result of a telepathic link to a twin; even 
more shockingly, Lissa’s twin was voluntarily given over to the government at birth, 
raised as a non-human Spare, and subjected to terrifying experiments. After find-
ing each other, Lissa and Lin escape aboard a government space vessel captained 
by Lissa’s longtime crush, Cadan, only to find that bounty hunters are on their 
trail. Action-packed and thoroughly engrossing, this novel offers readers a classic 
sci-fi, space-travel adventure at its best. Tightly controlled pacing regularly ups the 
tension but never at the expense of the emotionally wrought human relationships. 
Well-known genre conventions, like terraforming and hyperdrives, feel fresh and 
original, and the text gives equal time to intriguing alien worlds, awesome scientific 
inventions, and familiar family drama. The blossoming romance between Lissa and 
Cadan emerges in small, pulse-quickening moments, while the focus of the story 
stays with the sisters as they fight for Lin’s humanity and struggle to learn what it 
means to be family. Fans of hard science fiction with a smart, slightly gooey, heartfelt 
center will happily travel across the universe with these characters and anxiously 
await expected sequels.  AM

Amoral privilege has been the hallmark of Astrid’s upbringing, and she likes that

She’s therefore horrified when she’s expelled for cheating and her parents insist she 
attend public school (“Just hearing the words ‘public school’ out loud made my

just kicked her out. At public school, she’s coolly intrigued by the social jostling 
and ends up unexpectedly friends with two low-status outcasts, Lucy and Noah. 
She begins to become more than friends with Noah, until a family tragedy and a

Twelve-year-old Trout St. Kroix doesn’t care about the politics that caused the Robot 
Wars or the delicate truce between the United Districts and the Robot Territories 
that ended them. He only cares that his father never came home from the wars and 
that no sign of his implant signal has ever been found. When Trout takes matters 
into his own hands and posts a video to the net, begging for any information, it 
sets off a series of events that Trout never could have imagined. Now his brother 
has been taken hostage by his own government, his father has been revealed as the 
leader of a revolutionary movement for robot rights, and Trout is running for his 
life. Appealing just for its imaginative world-building and fantastic robots, this novel 
goes farther, offering a thrilling sci-fi adventure with added heart and smarts. The 
exciting kid-hero narrative combines with an equally compelling family story and a 
thought-provoking look at basic civil rights and who deserves to have them. Trout 
is a wonderfully relatable narrator on the verge of adolescence, frustrated by the 
fact that adults treat him like a child and desperate to prove himself worthy of trust 
and responsibility. He is backed up by a memorable cast of secondary characters 
that include a robot bodyguard-turned-best friend, a hilarious robot inventor, and 
two capable girl compatriots. Loose threads suggest the possibility of sequels, which

Seventeen-year-old Princess Adela longs to be a gardener, so when she is invited 
to a garden party given by the mysterious Lady Hortensia, Adela readily agrees. 
Things take a menacing turn at the soiree, though, when Adela secretly discovers 
that Lady Hortensia is a witch, turning her party guests into blooms for her garden. 
A jewelry-stealing, talking magpie, Krazo, tries to help Adela, eventually finding 
a ruby heart, the destruction of which turns Hortensia to stone, releases the other 
“flower,” and returns Krazo to his own shape as Edward, a thief who long ago tried

In this graphic-novel-styled memoir, cartoonist Lucy Knisley tells twelve stories 
about her life growing up in and around food culture. Her mother is a brilliant 
cook and her father a discriminating eater, so she focuses on the way sharing meals 
is central to relationships. As sidelights to her autobiographical vignettes, she de-
scribes how food culture has changed in New York City and Chicago, places where 
she was on hand to see how restaurants, gourmet food stores, and farmer’s markets 
went from being staffed by actors, musicians, and artists whose love for fine food 
outstripped their budgets to now being taken over by food professionals such as 
chefs and graduates of culinary arts programs. She documents how her mother’s 
work connecting her city contacts with the farmers in her new home changed their 
small town into a foodie paradise, how she and her best friends discovered new 
food experiences in Mexico, Japan, and Vienna, and how frustrating it can be to 
try to replicate the taste of that perfect croissant with the warm, oozing apricot 
filling. Recipes of some favorite dishes are included, and everything is illustrated 
with full-color cartoons that guide readers through a recipe step-by-step, as well 
as through the various experiences of her life as a bratty daughter of divorce, a 
city kid displaced to the wilds of country life, a rebellious celebrant of junk food, 
a frustrated home baker, and a dedicated young server for her mother’s catering 
business, to name a few. A subtle highlight of the book is her advocacy of hands-
on work: she gracefully shares the secret delights of being a server and working at 
a cheese counter, jobs that might not seem glamorous but have undeniable fringe 
benefits for a food lover. Readers who are already food lovers are the obvious audi-
ence here, but those even those who aren’t will have plenty to ruminate on through

Lanagan weaves her strange and often disorienting storytelling magic on familiar 
fairy tales and legends in this eerie a collection of short stories, some of which have

doubt recognize “The Golden Shroud” as a take on “Rapunzel,” but here the dam-

fashion. A retelling of the Passover legend serves as a testament to and a question 
of the powers of faith in one story, while elsewhere a bizarre and often violent 
tale pulls on the darker elements of Hans Christian Andersen’s already disturbing 
“The Tinderbox.” The familiarity of the stories and themes provide an access point 
to Lanagan’s innovative sentence structure and dense, eloquent prose, while the 
emotional rawness of the tales, focusing intensely on loss and disillusionment, is 
powerful enough to grab even less sophisticated readers. The opening dialogues of 
each story serve as both an invitation and a disorientation, and by the end of the 
collection, readers will have the satisfying feeling that they have just assembled a

In this intriguing graphic novel, fifteen-year-old Lin Carroll, new to the small 
town of Barnhurst, loves her self-published ’zine full of stories she’s written about 
adventurer Rhea Ironheart. When she witnesses a robbery in progress one day, she is 
transformed into a superhero herself, complete with skin-tight costume, high-tech 
weaponry, and a rose-petal trail, and she has to decide if she’s ready to be the heroine 
rather than simply write about one. At the same time, wealthy Barnhurst resident 
Mel and local guy Trace Vernon recover from a bad date by venting to their blogs, 
attracting the attention of a shadowy online figure intent on turning their misery 
into a weapon against Lin. This complex narrative evolves across a series of smooth 
graphic transitions. Lin is a relatably imperfect heroine, who thinks she knows 
about heroes until she is faced with being one; Mel and Trace eventually establish 
themselves as fully realized characters in their own right, adding a multifaceted 
undertone to the seemingly straightforward story of girl-turned-secret crime-fighter. 
The majority of the graphics employ black and white line drawings shaded in tones 
of gray, allowing Lin’s multiracial heritage (her father is light-skinned, her mother 
dark) to be evident without necessitating an overt mention. Colored panels are 
reserved for Lin’s superhero persona, costumed in shots of lilac purple. Overall, 
readers who like their novels with as many questions as answers will revel in this 
unique, challenging take on the superhero graphic novel.  AM

Fans of Alvin Ho (from Alvin Ho: Allergic to Dead Bodies, Funerals, and Other 
Fatal Circumstances, BCCB 1/12, etc.) know that he’s more than a little neurotic 
and that relatively ordinary problems send him into extraordinary panic. In this 
volume, he’s stressed about a rash of burglaries in the area, but that’s nothing com-
pared to the bomb his mother drops on him: she’s pregnant, and though she and 
Alvin’s father sat the family down and explained the situation months ago, Alvin 
somehow missed its implications. As soon as he realizes the truth, he develops 
symptoms of a “simply pathetic pregnancy,” which sends nearly all of the boys in 
his second-grade class into sympathetic pregnancies of their own. Luckily, Alvin 
has support: his best friend, Flea, makes him a Pregnancy Disaster Kit, and his 
big brother Calvin designs a Rube Goldberg machine to catch the burglar, and 
as usual, Alvin responds with his own version of over-reactive mayhem. Look has 
developed a canny balance between repetition and novelty in this series that offers 
support for developing readers while spurring growth in their comprehension of 
sophisticated concepts. As with previous books, she deploys a few central elements 
that track through the episodic plot while breaking it up into appealing chunks. 
Readers may be disappointed that the burglar is never actually caught, but they 
can nonetheless follow that thread to anticipate its humorous conclusion. These 
literacy-supporting elements, along with antic humor, energetic illustrations, and 
a strong but subtle message about how friends and family continue to wisely and 
patiently love this crazy little kid, make this another solid entry in a winning series 
for early readers.  KC

In the summer of 1967, the Haight District of San Francisco, where fifteen-year-old 
Joanne Donnelly lives with her very conventional family, is alive with the sounds

be intrigued by the alternative worldviews of the local hippie population, especially 
when beautiful hippie Martin gives her a set of love beads. Soon she is swept up in 
the heady fog of sex, drugs, and rock ’n’ roll that surrounds Martin and his friends. 
Though Joanne largely resists those temptations, she faces her own mind-altering 
experience in the combination of first love’s blind bliss and the anxiety of teen 
rebellion. The novel feels a little like a history lesson come to life: it’s a pretty sani-

optimistic in one emotionally packed year, is endearing. Readers looking for a

The wind blows a series of random shapes onto the blank white pages of this picture 
book, shapes that are then arranged as parts of various animals, with additional 
thin black lines completing details for each critter. A cumulative “House That Jack 
Built”–style litany accompanies the changing arrangement of shapes: they first 
take the form of a chicken’s head (“‘They’re mine!’ said the chicken. ‘I saw them 
lying around!’”), then the head, fin, and tail of a fish (“‘No, they’re mine!’ replied 
the fish. ‘I’m the one who cut the paper into the pieces that the chicken saw lying 
around’”), and so on. This continues from chicken to fish to bird to snail to frog, 
until the wind intercedes and scatters them toward the reader: “They’re yours now 
too. What will you do?” Although the story is very slight, the shape-rearranging is 
entertaining and the crisp, bold shapes—a large, light blue semi-circle, an orange 
pie-shaped wedge, a set of gray and black circles, and a red tulip-like shape—are 
visually appealing against the plain white backdrop. This title lends itself to a 
number of uses, from the obvious creative shape-arranging indicated in the book 
(a printable page of the book’s shapes is available online), to lessons on wind or 
simple drawing techniques à la Ed Emberley. Pair this with one of Lois Ehlert’s 
shape-based picture books such as Color Zoo (BCCB 9/89), Emberley’s Go Away, 
Big Green Monster (BCCB 3/93), or even Matisse’s famed cut-paper collages for a 
enjoyable lesson/storytime on shape and form.  JH

Eleven-year-old Elvis Ruby is a phenomenal talent: he can play just about any

shoo-in to win TweenStar, the reality show/performance competition, or at least 
he was until he froze on stage and immediately had to go into hiding at a family 
friend’s pancake restaurant in a small New Jersey town. Cecelia Wreel, a resident 
of that small town, couldn’t be more different from Elvis: she’s an unpopular, 
unmusical small-town girl (though she thinks she might like music if she could 
hear the song that her mother and father insist was playing through the pines on 
the night she was born in a cedar swamp in New Jersey). When Elvis shows up 
at her local pancake place disguised as a nondescript boy named Aaron, she sees 
him as a potential friend, but when she overhears him whispering his real name to 
the pines one night, she imagines that he, if anyone, can help her find her song. 
The infusion of the folkloric tropes of singing pines and the Jersey Devil adds a 
not-meant-to-be-subtle metaphor for the problems that beset the two; both are 
on the cusp of adolescence and searching for their identities in mostly the wrong 
places by trying to live up to the ideals of those around them. Threaded through 
the book are wisps of other themes, such as the power of music, the importance of 
maintaining tradition weighed against staying current, and the difficulty of keep-

becomes a harmonic whole, with abrupt shifts between subplots that readers will 
need to synthesize without much authorial assistance. It’s really the premise that 
takes center stage anyway: Elvis himself is a stand-in for an actual young pop star

presented not only about big and small bats, but also their large or little features 
(e.g. large ears on a Western pipistrelle, tiny suction-cup-like disks on the thumbs 
and ankles of the Spix’s disk-winged bat). The book mostly focuses on the ways in 
which the size of wings and other body parts aid in the bats’ survival, given their 
habitats. Facts are helpfully presented in short, succinct sentences, with each new 
tidbit (or each part of a more complicated explanation) getting a new line of text 
and generous spacing giving young readers time to absorb and digest each nugget of 
information before moving on to the next. More detailed information is presented 
in a smaller font in colored sidebars. Clear, well-chosen photographs—most of them

body parts or other qualities focused on in the text. A map pinpointing the locations

Nor does their wealth cushion them from misfortune: a younger brother is born

likely leave him comatose. She’s got to get out of Earth City and make her way

Johnny Vale, a handsome and broody commander of a starship, for intergalactic 
passage, but when she boards she realizes her mistake: Johnny’s a prolific pimp, 
she’s his latest whore, and he’s about to embark on a sadistic, cruel game that places 
her brother’s life in the balance. The sci-fi setting is well done here, but it mostly 
serves as an exotic backdrop for this brutal but insightful examination of an abusive 
relationship. McCarthy pulls no punches, exploring some of the most problematic 
romance tropes in YA with an analytical eye and a keen sense of humanity. Johnny 
is no damaged hero in need of a good woman’s love, but a violent narcissist; Rain is 
nonetheless attracted to him and while she is well aware of his true nature, she still 
occasionally finds pleasure in their sexual encounters. That neither redeems him nor 
makes Rain subconsciously complicit but instead points toward the complexities of 
human sexuality. Rain’s narration is merciless in its honesty and sometime graphi-

so is her will to live. Rain eventually triumphs over Johnny, but her scars remain,

Where the ocean laps the shore, there is salt, and nothing could be simpler for even 
the poorest of people than to “scoop [it] from the sea, boil it, clean it, sell it, buy it, 
sprinkle it.” Not surprisingly, Britain’s attempt to control salt as a taxable commodity 
in colonial India threatened the well-being of her poorest citizens and opened the 
door to reprisals. That the most widespread of these uprisings was largely nonviolent 
is attributable to Mohandas Gandhi and his march to the sea to claim the people’s 
right to appropriate their own salt. In the course of the march, he not only mod-
eled peaceful resistance but also championed the rights of the Untouchable class to 
take their place within the movement. McGinty’s picture-book presentation, tightly 
focused on this one event, is notable for its seemingly effortless contextualization of 
the movement and economical but deft introduction of biographical background 
on Gandhi himself. The ragged-right-edged prose, laced with rhythmic repetition 
and poetic devices, begs to be read aloud—a sound strategy and a literary pleasure 
for teachers using this within a classroom. Gonzalez uses double-page spreads ef-
fectively to depict both the growing size of the crowds as they join Gandhi’s march 
and the near-mythic figurative stature of the “small, brown-skinned” man himself. 
A strong selection for discussion of international civil rights movements, this is also 
a notable tie-in for programs or units on Martin Luther King, Jr. and the inspira-
tion for his own approach to civil disobedience.  Maps, quotation sources, and a 
brief bibliography are included.  EB

If anyone can appreciate subterfuge and deceit, it’s Elizabeth I’s courtiers, Lords 
William Cecil and Francis Walsingham. Acting as spymasters for the newly crowned 
queen, they establish and train a select cadre of ladies-in-waiting, each with a particu-
lar skill, to report on or even interrupt threats to Elizabeth’s reign. The latest recruit 
is pickpocket Meg Fellowes, who is valued more for her ability to commit speech 
to memory than for her light fingers. Considered hopelessly déclassé by her new 
peers, Meg nonetheless proves her mettle by reporting long strings of conversations 
among the visiting Spanish envoys, who are suspected of undermining the British 
crown. As if being privy to probable treachery weren’t perilous enough, Meg’s also 
up to her delectable neck in flirtation with Spaniard Count de Martine, and aware 
of the queen’s midnight assignations with her lover, Robert Dudley. McGowan 
has her work cut out for her, explaining the domestic and international machina-
tions at court, but the tight focus on Meg’s role in these slippery affairs of state 
476 • The BulleTin
steers the narration away from politics and toward cloak and dagger melodrama. 
Unfortunately, Meg slips from Elizabethan English into twenty-first century argot 
(“Nobody threw a party quite like the Queen of England”) too often, and the 
revelation of Meg’s family history, replete with court spies, is over the top. Readers 
intrigued by Meg and Martine’s stolen kisses and brassy repartee can take heart 
that McGowan has set them up for future meetings in the Maids of Honor series, 
though, and history supplies a trove of possible plot lines for them to follow.  EB

Jeremy Johnson Johnson has a gift: he can hear the voices of the dead. In particular, 
he has a familiar spirit who is really the main character here, the linguist and folktale 
collector Jacob Grimm. Jacob is the narrator, and while he’s unsure what unfinished 
business has him tethered to a spirit existence on earth, he knows that he must 
protect Jeremy from a malevolent creature called the Finder of Occasions, whose 
identity he has yet to ascertain. Jeremy, meanwhile, has become the town pariah 
due to a prank encouraged by the enigmatic and delightful Ginger, a spirited girl 
who finds Jeremy worthy of a reciprocated crush. Ginger and Jeremy are watched 
closely not only by Jacob but also by a dwarfish deputy and a warm-hearted baker, 
who each take an interest in the teen for his own reasons. Watchfulness isn’t enough 
to save the pair from the Finder’s evil scheme, though, and Jacob must eventually 
save Jeremy, in the process working through his own unresolved grief. The plot is 
twisty enough to surprise even the most seasoned reader, and Jacob’s lyrical narration 
belies his claims that brother Wilhelm was the more artful stylist. The characters are 
types lifted from traditional tales, but that is evident only upon reflection, as they 
are complexly developed and credible in a modern setting; indeed, puzzling out 
the connections between the contemporary small-town dynamics, small mistakes, 
TV game shows, high school relationships, psychopathic villains and their fairy-tale 
counterparts will surely be part of the fun for the geekily inclined. Enchanting, 
romantic, and tinged with terror, this modern story subtly weaves the haunting 
essentials of the fairy-tale tradition into a fascinating and beautifully written hom-
age to its source material.  KC

Unlike the rest of his snoozy family, Little Snippet the snail is an early riser, and 
this particular morning he is intent on waking his parents and sister up some a.m. 
fun. With the aid of various bug buddies, Snippet tries to rouse his sluggish family 
in a number of ways, from jumping on the “bed” (the family is attached to the 
underside of a leaf) to singing loudly to pushing on their shells, all to no avail. 
Caterpillar’s munching gives Snippet an idea, and he gathers a pile of his family’s 
favorite leaves, then chews through the “bed” leaf all around the sleeping family, 
June 2013 • 477
dropping them onto the leaf pile below, thus giving them “breakfast in bed.” The 
gentle garden world Murguia creates in both text and illustrations (rendered in 
watercolor, gouache, and ink) is a charming in its details: Snippet and his siblings 
munch star-shaped holes into leaves, Mama appears to have a ruby-encrusted shell, 
and the snails play soccer using a pill bug as the ball. Fresh white and soft tints 
of blue, green, and gold provide soothing backdrops for the brighter hues of the 
black-outlined bugs. Many families will relate to the mismatch between children’s 
and older folks’ waking times, so this might be a pleasant way to begin one of those 
early mornings at home. The snail facts tidily presented on the endpapers also make 
it a genial introduction to a snail nature study.  JH

Darius is an aspiring writer, Twig a rising track star, and together they are seeking a 
way to transcend the limitations their community seems to want to put on them. 
Twig’s family, for instance, wants him to work at his uncle’s bodega rather than train 
and compete, and Twig himself is sometimes ambivalent about what he wants for 
his future; running offers him a way to sort out his feelings in the present, but he’s 
not sure where and how he wants it to take him into his future. Darius watches 
the people in his neighborhood and tries to make sense of the complicated feelings 
that he and Twig have about who they are and who they want to be through the 
use of various metaphors that he uses in his stories, including an ongoing narrative 
about a falcon named Fury with whom Darius identifies. Not sure if he himself 
is raptor or prey, he must cope with bullies who seem determined to trample his 
spirit and constrict his future. At first, there is more exposition than action here, 
with a fair amount of introspection and description from Darius about his back-
story with Twig and the mundane events of their daily lives as well as the rage and 
helplessness Darius feels much of the time. This is Walter Dean Myers, however, so 
the plot gains urgency with some urban violence, and all that exposition becomes 
thematically relevant to Darius’ actions as well as his insights into why people, 
including him and his best friend, feel and behave the way they do. Through it 
all, a strong and simple message emerges about the way good friends can anchor 
each other through storms and spur one another into positive futures even when 
the present seems bleak.  KC

Finn and Autumn grew up next door to each other, with families that shared holi-
days, vacations, and weeknight dinners. They began to grow apart in junior high; 
then, in high school, they separated further as Autumn rejected the cheerleading 
set for an emo crowd in high school while Finn’s athlete status kept him with the 
popular kids, and they got the boyfriend and girlfriend that was expected of them. 
Despite the fact that Autumn really does love her boyfriend, Jamie, she never stops 
thinking about Finn, and she finally has to admit that while she loves them both, 
her revised lifestyle plans, which include a stable, ordinary life rather than the 
478 • The BulleTin
freewheeling writer’s existence she had envisioned with Finn, fit better with Jamie 
at her side. Autumn’s struggle to be practical about relationships rather than suc-
cumbing to a more romantic view of a consistent depth of passionate attachment 
is at the same time realistic and disappointing; her feelings for Jamie ebb and flow 
and that seems normal to her, given the pattern of her parents’ relationship and her 
bouts of seasonal depression. All the same, she clearly communicates the value of 
Finn, whose consistent love for her never wavered, even if she only now realizes it. 
This is a retrospective, however, written after Finn’s tragic death, and it is therefore 
threaded through with melancholic a longing as Autumn considers how things 
might have turned out differently had she had the courage to accept the love Finn 
offered. Finn is, of course, too perfect, as all dead soulmates must be, and their 
romance is Shakespeare-worthy in its tragic dimension. Autumn’s reflections on 
love’s possibilities and near-misses will surely resonate with the unsettled teen soul, 
and readers will get exactly what they came for, and then some.  KC

A guy’s got to earn a living, and when humble Parisian postman Lalouche loses his 
job (displaced by newfangled electric cars), he responds to a poster ad for sparring 
partners at the Bastille Boxing Club. The manager is incredulous: “I could sneeze 
and knock you down.” The boxing gloves and booties (yes, “booties,” since this is 
a century ago) are way too big, but Lalouche’s spirit is huge, and he nimbly twists 
the Grecque into a pretzel, outclasses Ampère, and launches the Piston right out 
of the ring. So much for sparring; the manager now promotes him to the main 
event, facing “The Undefeated Fight Sensation from the Jungles of the Amazon,” 
the Anaconda. Leaving his opponent hopelessly coiled in mid-ring makes Lalouche’s 
career, but he’s still a humble postman at heart; when the disastrous electric cars are 
retired, Lalouche is delighted to be called back to service. The amiable plotline has 
a cobbled-together feel, but Blackall’s pictures supply the visual humor to bring the 
silliness to life. Pieces of each composition are meticulously painted, layered, and 
photographed, and the resultant shadows lend an unexpected illusion of reality to 
the scrawny Lalouche as he overpowers each foe. A closing note includes photo-

crocodile” and would eat it all day if he could. But then he makes his mistake: “I

hearty burp reveals that his gastric distress had a different origin, and after a brief

punchy, with accessible humor and a modest emotional conflict that youngsters will 
recognize. While it’s not exactly debunking the myth (in fact, the visuals suggest that 
the croc is saved because the seed bounces back out of his mouth when he belches), 
there’s a tacit recognition of the bogusness of the factoid in the amusing hyperbole, 
so nervous youngsters will find the breezy exaggeration ultimately reassuring. Even 
the art is watermelon—the three-colored palette (watermelon-pink, rind-green, 
and seed-black) against matte cream pages echoes the fruity goodness and allows 
for maximum eye-popping contrast. Screen printing allows for sweet intensity and 
subtle textures in Ben Day dots and overprinting, while the pared-down simplicity of 
the spreads and lively incorporation of text into the images provides graphic oomph

How else could they dirt-bike off a milk carton and board ramp, skateboard over

being captured (by your father) and “dragged away to the villain’s lair” (the barber 
shop) where your dynamic force is reduced to a sad pile of clippings. Rocco’s concern 
that the barber will curtail his powers is only matched by his fear of what his friends

discover that the treasure may not exist after all—and that Pembroke is only getting

sell their enemies into slavery. The high-seas, swashbuckling adventure of the first 
installment takes a dark turn here as Egg and his pals survive pirates, plagues, and 
angry Natives, only to find themselves in the middle of a political war between 
a dizzying number of deceitful factions. The plot follows a classic adventure arc 
but remains nonetheless surprising: the characters never quite behave in expected 
ways, making unpredictable choices, and issues of human trafficking and slavery 
are rather delicately handled amidst the various swordfights, treasure hunting, and 
pirate shenanigans. Even though the world is fictional, the portrayal of the Na-

her insides is actually creepily unethical, the questionable moral dimension of his 
actions is called out by Harlan; Lenny is ultimately redeemed when he notices who

a fable than a fairy tale; the message that it is Faten’s will and determination—not 
some prince—that will save her is an admirable one, if a bit heavy-handed at times. 
The singular focus on Faten, however, becomes claustrophobic, and while readers 
see her terror in the face of a major bombing, little information is given about the 
conflict itself and the reasons behind it, making the surrounding turmoil seem like 
a superfluous addition. Regardless of the political backdrop, this is still an entirely

cry from the originality of Smith’s The Marbury Lens; the tragic twist at the end, 
involving the fate of Joey, especially rehearses a tired cliché about gay characters 
in YA literature, even if it has the credibility of the Matthew Shepard case behind 
it. Still, coming to terms with senseless cruelty and death is an essential element 
in the traditional coming-of-age teen novel, and the writing throughout remains 
sharp, funny, and perceptive about youthful male friendships. Readers who enjoy 
stylistically interesting stories about underdogs in boy world may therefore still find 
this witty and entertaining.  KC

Moe, Tabitha, and Elodie are three very different girls who end up sentenced to 
the same Shoplifters Anonymous support group. Moe is apparently hard-edged, 
an orphan living with her aunt and her brother and adopting the costume of the 
stoned and disaffected, even while she secretly listens to bubble-gum pop and makes 
out with the popular jock next door. Beautiful, popular, wealthy Tabitha is the 
prototypical A-lister, but she is disgusted with her philandering father and passive 
mother. Elodie is a closet poet, mourning the death of her mom and unhappy with 
her father’s remarriage while longing to have Tabitha’s life, or at least her boyfriend. 
Stealing gives the girls a thrill, providing a feeling of power and temporary fullness 
that covers over the emotional lacks in their lives. Kindred spirits in that way, the 
girls trigger one another’s dysfunction, so that after the SA meetings they chal-
lenge each other to steal stuff to share with one another. Meanwhile, though, the 
holes in their lives are filling up with the support of their unlikely friendship, and 
stealing loses both its necessity and its appeal. Herein lies the subtle wisdom of the 
book, that fixing the root cause, rather than merely addressing the symptom, is 
the only way to really solve a problem with addiction. Chapters alternate between 
the voices of the three girls, giving insight into three differing yet parallel motiva-
tions for shoplifting while creating characters that readers will find appealing and 
sympathetic whether or not they agree with their perspectives.  KC

The dark that fills the shadowy corners and the pitch-black basement of Laszlo’s 
old creaky house pays a visit to the boy in his bedroom one night. A nervous Laszlo 
asks what the dark wants, and it replies, “I want to show you something.” Laszlo 
checks the closet and behind the shower curtain, but it’s the basement where the 
dark wants him to go. Summoning his courage, Laszlo descends the stairs as the 
dark beckons him to come closer to a chest of drawers, where the boy finds a stash 
of glowing light bulbs the same size as the burnt-out one in his nightlight. Laszlo 
thanks the dark and returns to bed, visiting the basement next morning to say “Hi” 
to the dark; while the dark doesn’t answer, the still-open bottom drawer looks like

a smile, and the dark “never bothered him again.” This is an offbeat—and spookily 
atmospheric—approach to fear of the dark, with a creative story and high-impact 
artwork The limited perspective of Laszlo’s flashlight beam, shrouded around the 
edges in opaque blackness, allows for a pleasantly creepy build-up of suspense that 
is then cheerily deflated by the surprise benevolence of the dark. Klassen’s slightly 
retro gouache and digital art in attractive, muted tones is a perfect match for the 
text, with the diminutive Laszlo, clad in blue footie pajamas, a fine foil for all the 
matte black space lurking in doorways and behind curtains; sharp-eyed viewers 
will note the absence of Laszlo’s ever-present flashlight at book’s end, once he’s 
made peace with the dark. Kids comfortable with delicious shivers will find this 
an enjoyable thrill.  JH

In Teague’s version of this classic tale, a farm’s three pigs are evicted when the farm’s 
owners decide to move to Florida and leave them with a stipend for their services 
to the farm. Preferring to spend their money on potato chips and “sody-pop,” the 
first and second pigs build their houses out of familiar straw and sticks, respectively, 
leaving their companion to build a beautiful brick house, complete with a vegetable 
garden. When the “very hungry and somewhat bad” wolf arrives on the scene . . . 
well, the rest is history. This version remains faithful to tradition but adds a bit of 
extra silliness (after blowing the first pig’s house down, the wolf exclaims, “I can’t 
believe that worked!”) that will provide interest even for listeners who know the 
story. Teague’s signature full-bleed oil illustrations evoke 1950s Americana through 
their use of visual details such as deliverymen in folded white paper hats and bright 
turquoise motor scooters, yet tightly curled twigs and lopsided houses make it very 
clear that this is a fairy-tale environment. Oversize pages and a happy ending with a 
rehabilitated wolf make this an excellent readaloud choice. A solid modernization of 
a classic, this book works well as standard folkloric fare for the picture-book set.  TA

Twelve-year-old Abbey Force is feeling “meaner than a stepped-on-rattlesnake,” and 
she’s got good reason: last year, her lawyer father had an accident and fell into a 
coma, and since then he’s been accused of stealing from one of his wealthiest clients, 
forcing the sale of Abbey’s childhood home, Reward Plantation, and the relocation 
of Abbey to the house of her abusive uncle. Her only joy now that school’s let out 
is her job taking care of Reward’s horses, and it’s at the stables that Abbey meets 
Bee, the daughter of Reward’s newest owner. After a bit of awkwardness, the girls 
become fast friends, and their afternoon adventures on the plantation’s estate lead 
to a few key discoveries: first, there’s something suspicious going on down at Felony 
Bay, which is technically part of Reward, and second, it may have something to do 
with Abbey’s uncle, her dad’s shady business partner, and the accident that maybe

wasn’t an accident after all. Wonderfully inventive colloquialisms and true Southern 
sass mark Abbey’s narration, and she’s impossible not to like, even when she’s being 
a bit too precocious for her own good. The bad guys are apparent from the begin-
ning, but it’s puzzling out how they fit together and what exactly their scheme is 
that will keep readers turning the pages. A character in itself, the South Carolina 
setting is fully realized with the danger and beauty of its swampy backwoods a factor 
in every chapter. Future fans of Grisham will find this immensely satisfying, as will 
readers who were enchanted by Turnage’s Three Times Lucky (BCCB 7/12).  KQG

Lindy is forced to stay home from school for weeks due to a bout of mononucleosis, 
so her father comes up with a unique way for her to pass the time: she can have 
$100 to invest in the stock market however she chooses, using her father’s online 
trading account. When she’s able to return to school, Lindy is still obsessed with 
being a twelve-year-old broker, much to the annoyance of her friends Howe and 
Steph, who have grown significantly closer during her absence. After her continued 
itch for the market leads her to invest her parents’ capital in what turns out to be a 
$25,000 loss, she’s desperate to make the money back and turns to her sister, who 
has a tip on a failed blow-dryer prototype. Lindy is able to short sell the blow-dryer 
company’s stock in order to recoup her losses, but she attracts the attention of the 
Securities Exchange Commission in the process, becoming the youngest person to 
be tried by the SEC. The plot is conscious of the absurdity of the trial, but this is a 
highly original story effectively told, and it’s surprisingly full of useful information 
on the ins and outs of trading. Lindy’s troubles with her friends, as she processes 
her jealousy at their relationship, provide a touching counterpoint to the high-
stakes escapades of her trading world with a credible exploration of the vagaries 
of middle school relationships. A readable and interesting thought experiment for 
young tycoons, this would provide a unique opportunity to pair literature with a 
classroom study of the stock market.  TA

Silent films are the inspiration for Mo Willems’ new outing, with a cast of play-
ers including “Hungry Fox, Plump Goose, and Baby Geese.” When Hungry Fox 
and Plump Goose lock eyes across a picturesque cobblestoned street, it’s love at 
first sight. Or is it? The fox invites the goose for a stroll, then asks her into the 
“deep, dark woods” and then into his “nearby kitchen,” which delights the goose; 
the goslings, however, interject a warning (“That is NOT a good idea!”) that gets 
stronger by a “really” with each new step toward vulnerability. The joke’s on the 
fox—and the first-time reader—however, as the goose turns out to have been lur-
ing the fox into the soup pot all along, and it’s the fox to whom her goslings have 
been issuing a sportsmanlike warning. The cinematic layout balances silent-movie 
dialogue slides, white text on black backgrounds with flourish-touched borders,

with full-page scenes of Fox and Goose and zoomed round-bordered close-ups of 
Goose, seemingly innocently eyeing the camera; the goslings’ warnings are intercut 
like warnings from a Greek chorus, albeit a comically fuzzy yellow Greek chorus. 
Kids will clamor for a re-viewing and be pleased to note that the book cleverly 
sets itself up for the story going either way. This is also a delight to voice, with the 
goslings particularly enjoyable to act out, so you could easily draft kids to handle 
the warnings themselves or set this up as a dramatic piece.  DS

After just one misstep on the edge of the school roof during the traditional egg-
drop experiment, Paige is dead. Unfortunately, she’s stuck roaming the grounds 
of the school where she died, accompanied only by Brooke, a girl who died of an 
overdose a few months before her, and Evan, a boy who killed himself years ago. 
Paige is still focused on high school drama, however, and particularly on Lucas, 
the popular jock whom with she was secretly having an affair. When a rumor arises 
that she killed herself she’s determined to quash it; she discovers she can enter and 
control other people’s bodies, so she uses that ability to spread counter-rumors and 
then to humiliate the classmate who insists that Paige deliberately jumped. As she 
literally gets under people’s skins, however, she begins to gain a little more perspec-
tive—and also realizes that there’s something stranger than simple haunting going 
on at her school. There are echoes of Our Town in Paige’s regretful visiting among 
the living, while her desperate insistence on being remembered—and how she is 
remembered—is keen, understandable, and teenageresque. The book is clearly aware 
both of the temptations and the ethical bankruptcy of her making other people do 
things to serve her purpose, and her harsh dismissals of some of her agemates make 
her realistically immature without completely forgoing reader sympathy. The twist 
at the end helps answer some niggling questions, but the story is less one of twisty 
mystery than post-mortem perspective.  It’s also a quick and appealing tale, and 
it could draw reluctant as well as regular readers who’d like to imagine what their 
schoolmates would say about them after they’re gone.  DS

“You’re in there and I’m out here, outside mama’s belly. I’m waiting for you!” says 
the eager soon-to-be big sister in this French import, who in a sequence of spreads 
addresses her gestating sibling in Mom’s abdomen to talk about what they’ll do 
and to share excitement about the baby’s arrival. It’s design that really makes the 
book, as in every spread the girl’s musings on the recto face an image of Mom’s 
growing belly, with a liftable tab revealing a baby who grows increasingly larger as 
the months go by. The visuals are airily whimsical, with crisp yet scrawly linework 
and with touches of scribbled color floating across the creamy pages; the patterns 
on the mother’s ballooning belly correspond neatly to elements in the girl’s world, 
and touches of graphic creativity add interest to the flap that hides the burgeoning 
baby (who’s essentially a full-grown infant, tumbling and cooing). Unfortunately, 
the flaps aren’t likely to stand up to library-level use, and since there’s no tension or

Life changed for sixteen-year-old Lucy Beck-Moreau eight months ago, when she 
deliberately stepped away from her career as a piano prodigy and quit at the height 
of an international competition. Since that’s an unforgivable sin to her domineering 
grandfather (and therefore to the rest of the Beck-Moreaus), her family is largely 
ignoring Lucy and concentrating on her similarly gifted younger brother, Gus. As 
Lucy struggles to figure out who she is without music, Gus bonds with his new 
young teacher, Will, an easygoing and approachable guy. Will is so approachable, 
in fact, that Lucy finds a friend in him too, beginning to share with him her am-
bivalence about leaving music. Her confiding in Will gives her space to see that 
she might be ready to return, but her feelings for Will—married twenty-something 
Will—are going way past the merely friendly. The ever-capable Zarr creates an ut-
terly believable family in the Beck-Moreaus, with layers of function and dysfunction 
melding into one another. Lucy is particularly credible in her self-absorption and 
her attempts to recreate the older male approval she used to receive for her music 
in Will. Since being responsible for Lucy’s return to the stage would be a feather 
in his cap, Will, too, is an interestingly complicated character with his mixture of 
genuine tenderness toward Lucy, self-interest, and a soupçon of lust. Lucy’s life and 
possibilities may be fascinatingly exotic, but her desire to determine her own path 
will resonate with teen readers, especially those beginning to question where their 
own gifts will lead them. Notes will be included in the bound book.  DS

Middle-schooler Aliya would prefer to just fade into the background, but she’s one 
of the few Indian-Americans or Muslims at her mostly white school, which makes 
her a target for both bullies and innocent but awkward questions. Additionally, her 
parents’ liberal interpretation of their religion and Aliya’s choice not to wear the 
hijab cause tensions between her and her more conservative friends at Quran study, 
and she’s disconcerted by Marwa, the new girl who also happens to be Muslim 
and whose quiet confidence both unnerves and inspires Aliya. An assignment from 
religious class has Aliya writing letters to Allah, inviting comparison to Blume’s 
classic Are You There God, Its Me, Margaret (BCCB 2/71), and indeed this deals with 
many similar themes: the physical changes of adolescence, crushes, friendship, and 
middle school politics. Aliya is entirely believable as a girl who’d really just rather 
avoid conflict altogether, so she’s sympathetic even when her actions aren’t all that 
admirable. The complexities of race relations are also delicately handled: Aliya faces 
some clearly racist attacks when she is called a terrorist, but the author also includes 
instances of well-intentioned people saying the wrong, and often ignorant, thing 
(Aliya’s principal mistakenly and enthusiastically identifies Aliya as Arabic; Aliya’s 
grandmother conflates Chinese people and Korean people in front of Aliya’s Korean-

 “There are two places I belong in the world,” says a young girl. “The first place 
I belong is my house in the city. The second place I belong is my grandmother’s 
house in the country.” As she rides the sleek train that takes her from the city to 
the country, she explains her love of traveling (“One day, I will travel everywhere. 
I will go here. I will go there. I will go this way and I will go that way. I will know 
the entire world”) and the adult skepticism with which her plans are received (“My 
mother and my grandmother always say, ‘You’ll see!’”). Ultimately, though, the nar-
rator remains determined, vowing that “when I am big, I will make sure life moves 
with me.” The text focuses on an issue that’s keen for many young people, their 
belief in plans that get dismissed by adults, but its abstraction, gentle dreaminess, 
and lack of plot take it out of child reach and make it more of an adult conceit. 
Kids may nonetheless enjoy poring over the fascinating artwork: elaborate, precise 
linework landscapes fill the elongated spreads, offering Anno-like detail and absorb-
ing transitions as the narrator’s train, an eye-catching chartreuse, with zingy orange 
doors and green windows, zips through the scenery. That scenery blends the literal 
and the imagined, with some spreads featuring huge sandcastle towers and weird 
unrecognizable animals, others junkpiles and trainside meadows. This could help 
turn a train journey into a fantasy ride, and kids who travel a regular route between 
homes (or between parents) may be intrigued by the heightened possibilities.  DS

We’re pleased this month to bring to print our annual Stellar Series list, a previously 
online-only feature that highlights notable series. While the multiple-volume boom 
is certainly popular with readers, it has presented a unique challenge to reviewers. 
The individual books that make up a series are parts of a greater whole, often rely-
ing on the previous and subsequent installments to inform their plot, character 
development, themes, etc., yet such literary achievements do not translate easily 
into an individual volume’s inclusion in an annual best-of-the-year list. Our Stellar 
Series list recognizes those books that collectively achieve the level of excellence 
that our Blue Ribbons salutes in individual titles. The series listed here have at 
least three volumes, the most recent of which has been published in the last twelve 
months. While some of these series are a completed trilogy, tetralogy, etc., others 
may not have concluded, but their existing volumes nonetheless constitute a series 
achievement worth recognizing.
Political conflict seems to be the theme of this year’s group, as it includes 
two works of historical fiction set during war, one a captivating portrait of a fam-
ily of exiled royals during World War II, the other a tightly focused look at four 
teens changed forever by their service in the Vietnam War. The battle between two 
fictional lands in our third series is no less powerful, although it is especially suited 
for those readers who like their fantasies epic and their heroes flawed. 
Just in time for the lazy days of summer, this list gives readers plenty to keep 
them entertained and absorbed as they while away those long, sunny afternoons.

always the most belligerent, can hardly wait to get to the Army recruiter; Beck, the 
brainiac, withstands his family’s disappointment as he abandons his college plans 
and joins the Air Force. Readers are forced into the thick of the action, but it’s the 
devastating emotional impact and the realistic portrayal of a friendship changed 
forever that will stick with readers long after the last shot is fired.

actions while keeping a tight focus on their emotional lives. The obstacles in their 
relationships mirror the tensions built by prejudices and ignorance throughout 
their lands, and the setbacks they experience as they work toward peace, both as a 
community and as individuals, are painfully authentic. Readers of high fantasy and 
fans of Game of Thrones will find this series utterly engrossing. KQG

Bloody Murder
The Homicide Tradition in 
Children’s Literature
������������������
Given the long-standing belief that children 
ought to be shielded from disturbing life 
events, it is surprising to see how many 
stories for kids involve killing. Bloody Murder 
is the first full-length critical study of this 
pervasive theme of murder in children’s 
literature. Through rereadings of well-
known works, such as Alice’s Adventures 
in Wonderland, the Nancy Drew Mystery 
Stories, and The Outsiders, Michelle Ann 
Abate explores how acts of homicide con-
nect these works with an array of previously 
unforeseen literary, social, political, and 
cultural issues. 
Bloody Murder adds to the body of inquiry 
into America’s ongoing fascination with 
violent crime. Abate argues that when 
narratives for children are considered along 
with other representations of homicide in 
the United States, they not only provide a 
more accurate portrait of the range, depth, 
and variety of crime literature, they also 
alter existing ideas about the meaning of 
violence, the emotional appeal of fear, and 
the cultural construction of death and dying

“Abate is very persuasive about the 
value of bringing children’s literature 
into a scholarly conversation with 
other disciplines.”
