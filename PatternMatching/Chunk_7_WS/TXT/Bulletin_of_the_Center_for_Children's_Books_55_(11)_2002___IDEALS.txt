"These 14 poems, inspired by artist Stephen Alcorn's masterful
woodcuts, celebrate animals in all their bizarre shapes and fierce
wildness. From the bouncy, rhymed couplets of Lillian Fisher's
'Camel' to the single line of contemplative free verse in Tony
Johnston's 'Iquana,' the poems range widely in style and tone....
A rich and satisfying collection that will be used widely across the
curriculum."-Starred review / ALA Booklist
"Featuring new work by such favorites as Karla Kuskin, Ralph
Fletcher, Janet S. Wong, and Alice Shertle, this collection forms a
unique whole. Fans of any of the fine poets [found here] will find
plenty to enjoy." -School Library Journal
"Alcorn's powerful visual imagery underpins and binds together this
striking tribute to the grandeur of nature's creatures." -The Horn Book

THE BIG PICTURE
This Land Was Made for You and Me: The Life &
Songs of Woody Guthrie
by Elizabeth Partridge
Woody Guthrie wandered tirelessly through America and lent his voice and music
to the causes of the downtrodden people he met, but he was no angel. In celebrat-
ing his legacy, many biographers have chosen to take an adulatory path and ignore
Guthrie's darker side. Not so with this volume, which presents an unflinchingly
accurate portrait of a rambling and unpredictable man whose amazingly prolific
output and true genius for creating memorable songs earned him a place in Ameri-
can music history, despite his tendency to crash on friend's couches until the wel-
come had long soured.
Partridge's succinct and quick-shifting prose captures the disjointed
rhythms of the events in Guthrie's complex life, from his childhood in the depths
of the Dust Bowl and the Depression under the dubious protection of a mother
who was slowly succumbing to Huntington's disease, to his several failed mar-
riages, which were not helped by his lifelong propensity to disappear for lengthy
intervals with no warning. A creative energy propelled him through life, leaving
those around him amazed and often baffled by his wandering attention. The
author crafts her descriptions to reflect the rapidity and wildness of Guthrie's tal-
ent: "He brimmed with brilliant schemes and wild ideas. He drew constantly, put
out a newsletter about what he and his friends were doing, and always had stacks of
library books around. At any moment he would start talking about his latest
interest. Whenever he had a little money he'd buy a notepad and jot down words
to a song."
In addition to a panoply of archival photographs, which add realism to
this engrossing story of a life, the book includes carefully selected quotes from
songs, acquaintances, and documents to punctuate the story with authenticating
detail without detracting from the momentum of the narrative. Comments from
friends, particularly Guthrie's close friend Pete Seeger, offer interesting insights
into the positive and negative effects of Guthrie's restless energy on those around
him. After watching Guthrie wander off from his young wife and three children,
leaving them no means of support, Seeger asked, "Is that the price of genius?... Is
it worth paying?" Seeger saw both sides of Guthrie, though, and marveled at his
prolific output: "Lord, Lord, he turned out song after song!"
Partridge also sheds light on the vagaries of popularity, showing how
close Guthrie came to falling into obscurity, not once but many times throughout
his life. His brief commercial successes always crumbled, as did most of his rela-
tionships with fellow artists (and all of his romantic relationships). In addition,
Guthrie's behavior grew more outrageous as he grew older; he and his friends
blamed his consumption of alcohol, until doctors diagnosed him, at age forty-two,
394 
* THE BULLETIN
with Huntington's disease, the same degenerative neurological disorder that had
sent his own mother to an asylum. Then, in a final twist in a life full of winding
roads, while Guthrie was deteriorating dramatically in a hospital room, folk music
became the genre of a generation, and Guthrie became known as one of the endur-
ing creators of modern folk music. Long after he had ceased to be able to commu-
nicate or move a muscle voluntarily, his son Arlo Guthrie and old friend Pete
Seeger would bring their guitars to the hospital to sing duets: "Woody could no
longer applaud, but his eyes shone with tears."
This accurate and honest portrait of Woody Guthrie does not soften his
edges, but it shows in engrossing details the constant, unstoppable tide of creation
that carried him through life, and it offers a sense of the passion that drove this
brilliant songwriter to become one of the most important musicians in the history
of our nation. To round out the volume, there are general source notes and end-
notes, a bibliography, and an index. (Imprint information appears on p. 415.)

After soldiers of the dominant Yusulu clan massacred his Kibu family, Kaninda
joined the rebel forces for the express purpose of killing Yusulus. The atrocities
Kaninda witnessed in Lasai, his fictional African homeland, are described in itali-
cized flashbacks sandwiched between accounts of his present life in gritty south
London, where he was taken after being "rescued," first by the Red Cross and then
by a woman whose Salvation Army-style ministry took responsibility for six young
refugees. Thinking of himself as a prisoner of war, Kaninda lives with Captain
Betty, her quiet husband, and thirteen-year-old Laura (who provides the novel's
other major perspective), waiting for a chance to hop an Africa-bound freighter
and get back to the fighting. Soon, however, he gets pulled into a "stupid war"
between gangs based in neighboring housing projects, a war "all about risk and the
thrill of it, where hatred and violence gave some purpose for their lives. It was for
that-and for the pride of the tribe." This is a touch programmatic and slightly
sentimental (especially in its treatment of female characters, such as Laura), but it's
nonetheless plausibly constructed and approachably written. Because Kaninda
uses in London many of the survival skills he developed in war-torn Lasai, the
novel effectively emphasizes the similarities between his new and his old environ-
ments, making some thought-provoking parallels, and the final message of hope is
certainly a welcome one. A note describes the author's inspiration and research.

nosed with trachoma by Ellis Island examiners, and Da must take him back to
Ireland, leaving his wife and three daughters in the care of his brother. There's
only a half-hearted welcome from Uncle Patrick and his cool, thoroughly assimi-
lated wife, and soon Ma and little Bridget catch the first steamer home. Seven-
teen-year-old Rose and her younger sister Maureen are determined to make it in
America, and, after a false start in a sweatshop, Rose finds them both lodgings in
the apartment of a Jewish immigrant and his teenage daughter, Gussie, a seam-
stress and union activist. Gussie helps Rose land a promising position with her
own employers, and if adolescent readers don't immediately recognize the signifi-
cance of the Triangle Shirtwaist Company, they soon will. Just as Rose makes
friends and draws her first paycheck, she's caught in the infamous fire of 1911 and
barely escapes with her life. Scenes at Ellis Island capture the intense pressure and
split-second decision of a family torn apart the moment its hopes are highest, and
the Triangle workrooms are so carefully described early on that the crush and
pandemonium of the laborers' panicked flight is nearly palpable. Auch skillfully
condenses sweeping themes of American immigrant experience into Rose's story;
readers ready to migrate from series historical fiction should find it riveting. EB

Poor Little Wolf doesn't feel he's up to the standard of his brothers and sisters, so
he's hiding behind the oak tree while his sibs are out frolicking. When Big Gray
checks on his woebegone pup, he hears a litany of anxiety ("Frankie says that I do
not roll in a straight line.... Ana says I'm a slowpoke.... Will I ever pounce as
high as Tyler?"). The wise parent responds to his pup's whines by addressing not
only his pup's present capabilities ("Straight lines can be a bother") and their right-
ness ("You run like a soft breeze . . . That is just as it should be") but also the
certainty of greater skills to come ("High pounces come later"). Though the un-
derlying acorn/oak metaphor lacks the bolstering specificity of the rest of the text
and leaves the end slightly weak, the text is reassuring and enjoyably humorous,
especially in Little Wolfs puppyish demonstrations of his shortcomings ("Before
the little wolf had gotten very far, his run had become a galumph. And soon after,
it was just a toddle"). Aruego and Dewey's illustrations give Little Wolf his rueful
due: the wayward lines have an expressive energy reminiscent of Sandra Boynton,
and the comic effects (Little Wolf leaves a cartoonish wake when he runs) and
clever compositions (an upside-down little Wolf, just finished with his rolling dem-
onstration, continues his t8te-e-tete with Big Gray) don't detract from the sympa-
thy of their portrayal of the put-upon little guy. All youngsters feel outstripped by
somebody, so Little Wolfs plight will be widely recognized, and Big Gray's confi-
dence will be welcome everywhere. DS

into bed with his stuffed animals and his dad comes in and tells him a story-just
one, no matter how much Austin begs. When the family visits at Uncle Roy's two-
story house, Austin successfully negotiates for two stories; when Dad wins a fiddle
contest and they check into a fancy eleven-story San Antonio hotel-well, you get
the picture. This unusual depiction of family life on the road will have a lot of
romantic appeal for young listeners, and the cozy minimalism of the trailer (and
the absence of formalized schooling) is sure to give them wanderlust. A strong
sense of momentum, built while the family travels from place to place, is anchored
by the nightly bedtime ritual. Smith's watercolors are breezy and lighthearted; she
comically squeezes the scenes inside the family trailer into appropriately tight frames,
while rendering the dance hall and road sequences in more spacious spreads. The
warm-toned family has individual personality yet also a broad range of ethnic pos-
sibility that will allow many kids to see their own families reflected in the charac-
ters. Images from Dad's retold folktales appear in balloons, giving additional clues
to the tales' identities, and a good librarian will be able to answer listeners' requests
for the stories that Austin's daddy told him. JMD

When a runaway truck hits eleven-year-old Will and his seven-year-old sister,
Wenny, they both die; Will, however, is revived at the hospital, while Wenny is
gone forever. After he wakes up, Will begins to write letters to Wenny, chronicling
his parents' agony and his own anger and bewilderment, things he's reluctant to
utter out loud ("How the air in the house feels like it weighs a thousand pounds,
how I'm mad at Mom and Dad for being so sad, how you totally screwed up my
life by dying"). Once home, he's taken with the idea of investigating an infamous
tunnel in a nearby park, thinking that because his near-death experience took him
into a tunnel, he may be able to contact Wenny there. Especially in light of Will's
survivor guilt, this is poignant subject matter, and the additional aspect of Will's
revival adds an unusual component of spiritual exploration. The family's near-
dissolution, with the surviving child virtually ignored in the face of parental grief,
is touching and credible, and there's intimacy in the square, diary-esque trim size.
This isn't quite up to the standard of recent sibling-death dramas such as Wallace-
Brodeur's Blue Eyes Better (BCCB 3/02), however: Will's near-death experience is
never really satisfactorily explored (and the notion that his return to life and Wenny's
permanent departure were individual choices is a strange but undispelled one),
sentimentality occasionally obscures the raw edges of grief, and the book's pacing
is often ponderous, slowed by repetition and by reiteration of already-clear mes-
sages. There's nonetheless some compelling drama here, and readers will be moved
by Will's struggle with survival. DS

all white) beneath a boxed "Patriotism" P (where children sell lemonade for the
Red Cross); a bannered quote from John Adams proclaims, "Our obligations to
our country never cease but with our lives." In this vision, America the Beautiful
is a fait accompli rather than a messy, challenging work in progress, and the glori-
ous struggles-for independence, for suffrage, for racial equality-all lie in the
past. The celebration is exuberant but shallow: contemporary heroes and hero-
ines are generic or non-controversial ("elected officials," I. M. Pei, a grandfatherly
veteran-white-sharing photos with pajama'd tykes), and biographical detail is
consigned to appended notes; the alphabetic format strains to unite the disjointed
narrative. Glasser's cramped line-and-watercolor pastiches depict a nation of smiles
(from the satisfied grin of Navajo code talkers, to laughing immigrants approach-
ing Ellis Island), where "Main Street, U.S.A." is cozily lined with church, temple,
mission, and mosque, and everyone snuggles under a common blanket of prosper-
ity. Nonetheless, Cheney's expressed hope that her opus "will most often be read
and discussed by parents and children together" suggests a use that many adults
may welcome, and families whose patter is generally limited to homework assign-
ments and practice schedules could find a springboard for more substantive dia-
logue here. EB

Keegan Flannery blames himself for his mother's emotional breakdown, for the
suicide of a classmate (which he witnessed but did not prevent), and most of all for
the infant death of his twin brother, Michael. Festering guilt gradually becomes
firm conviction that Michael demands atonement, and Keegan believes that tak-
ing his own life on his sixteenth birthday is the only way to set his family's world
back in balance. While carefully planning his final release, Keegan accepts a chal-
lenge to participate on his high school's wrestling team, and he welcomes the un-
relenting, pounding pain as cleansing penance for his crimes. As the punishing
sport strengthens his undersized body, he begins to connect tenuously with boys
on the team, to hope for a rapprochement with his distant, silently grieving father,
and to discover some compelling reason to ignore Michael's voice and grasp life
again. Tension steadily escalates as chapter headings mark the countdown, Michael's
voice becomes more urgent, and Keegan's plans for his demise become ever more
detailed. Connelly, however, keeps a glimmer of hope alight throughout and de-
livers a resolution that is not only welcome but credible and humane. EB

Unlike the rest of his family, Little Joe can't swim: "His brother and sister swam
like fishes. His mom swam like a powerboat. But Little Joe just didn't get it."
When a little green frog hops into the pool and causes all sorts of consternation
amongst Joe's family members ("They all splashed about like crazy people, trying
to catch Frog"), only Little Joe stays quiet, watching. After everyone leaves, a
careful Little Joe lifts a very tired, very scared Frog out of the pool, telling him,
"Go home, Frog. Go home where it's safe." Frog hops back to his pond, and
Little Joe hops into the pool, where, with strong kicks of his legs, he swims across
"just like Frog." The writing is bland and the story's message somewhat puzzling,
but the low-key suspense is effective. Though the human figures are stiff and
literal, the watercolor illustrations offer a splashy mix of blue water and white tile
set in a green grassy yard brightened throughout by sunny skies. Listeners anxious
over Frog's fate will appreciate both of Joe's unheralded accomplishments. JMD

Twelve-year-old Casey's life spins out of control the day her stepmother, Sylvia,
fails to come home, and Casey realizes that Sylvia, who's been Casey's only parent
since the death of her father, has taken off with her boyfriend (no fan of Casey,
who dislikes him in return). She's determined to keep Sylvia's absence a secret,
carry on daily life in their New York apartment, and retain her belief that her
stepmother will return. Fortunately, she's abetted by the superintendent's teen-
aged foster son, who at first has his own agenda (he convinces Casey to steal an old
lady's money) but who then finds a friend in her and a refuge in her apartment
from his foster father's abuse. While there's an obvious survival-story appeal to the
plot, more important is the story of family and forgiveness and the finding of both;
Casey's narration is tremulous and heartfelt yet realistically understated as she
struggles to cope both with her situation and with the tremendous betrayal of her
caretaker. There's also life and genuine originality in the rest of the cast: Paulie,
the super's foster son, who first seems to be a tough guy but then proves a genuine
ally who envies Casey the faith she retains in familial possibilities; Fran, Sylvia's
pragmatic mother, a des ex machina with Lord & Taylor shopping bags who
turns up to save Casey from the super and the law; even Sylvia herself, warm-
hearted, loving, and deeply regretful of having succumbed out of desperation to
weakness. Ultimately, there's something of Hamilton's Sweet Whispers, Brother
Rush here in the message of moving past terrible mistakes to find strength in one's
family bonds. DS

In this photoessay examining a day in the life of a modern-day Maya village in
Belize, the succinct text introduces individuals from the village by first name and
describes the task in which each villager is engaged ("Each morning, Dominica
and the other women take the family's laundry to the creek. Dominica gives the
hammock a thorough scrub on the flat washing stone"). Each spread features a
color snapshot of the villager on the left, paired with a full-page, closeup photo of
his or her hands engaged in the mentioned task (such as weaving huipils, cooking
tor-tillas, sowing maize, playing musical instruments, etc.) on the right. There are
some evocative concrete details of daily life, and the hands focus is an intriguing
and appropriate one for a village still dependent on manual labor. The text is
superficial, however, somewhat romanticizing Maya life, and the author under-
plays the constant, backbreaking work of finding daily sustenance with few mod-
ern conveniences. The photographs are sharp and vivid, but there's a travel-brochure
air to some of the pictures of happy villagers and smiling children. The concentra-
tion on folk art-related tasks and the importance of family and community instead
of on the hardships of daily life is an understandable choice for this audience,
however, and this will be a serviceable introduction to a very old culture's contem-
porary life. A note from the author describing her experiences with the Maya
opens the book; a map and brief glossary are included. JMD

When older couple Sairy and Tiller Morey decide to leave their rural home and go
on separate vacations, they seek traveling companions in the form of thirteen-year-
old orphan twins Dallas and Florida Carter. Mr. and Mrs. Trepid, the unfit man-
agers of the Boxton Creek Home for Children, are only too glad to get Dallas and
Florida (whom they call "trouble twins") off their hands, and Mr. Trepid sees an
opportunity to get rich off the wealthy Moreys, who have piles of money (earned
from selling their folk-art woodcarvings) buried on their property. Dreamy Dallas
and feisty Florida are initially suspicious of the amiable couple's warm overtures;
eventually, though, they find themselves settling into life in Ruby Holler as they
wait for the vacations to begin, while Tiller and Sairy realize how much they've
missed having children around the place. A near-disastrous trial run for the canoe-
ing and hiking excursions briefly leaves the twins' future with the Moreys in doubt,
but a fairy-tale ending finds greedy Mr. Trepid served his just deserts and Dallas
and Florida assured of a happy home with Tiller and Sairy. There's an appealing
folkloric tinge to this novel, from the forest setting, to the characters (kind and
wise elders, orphan twins, a greedy villain) to a pair of possibly magical birds (one
gold, one silver) who reappear throughout the book. Reluctant readers may also
appreciate the very short chapters (some are no more than two pages in length) and
the easygoing dialogue. Creech spends a bit too much time describing the thoughts
and feelings of the adults, and the setup, the folksy dialogue, and the rustic atmo-
sphere occasionally seem a bit forced, but orphan and folktale fans (and adult
readers-aloud) will likely find this just as satisfying as Tiller and Sairy's "getting-

dents, then moves onto a discussion of the hospital and its efforts, both veterinary
and financial. The volume's usefulness as a reference work is limited by its some-
what random organization, but there's a multitude of factual pachyderm tidbits

insight into an interesting project, and a gallery of irresistible baby elephant photo-

A long-term queen thinks it's time to abdicate in favor of her son, the crown
prince, so she's determined to marry him off ("You're getting married and that's
all there is to it!"). Though the reluctant crown prince (who's "never cared much
for princesses") eventually accedes to his mother's wishes, the parade of hopeful
princesses is disappointing until the arrival of Princess Madeleine-accompanied
by her handsome brother, Prince Lee. The two princes fall instantly into fairy-tale
love and they're married in a lovely ceremony, resulting in satisfaction for all ("The
two princes are known as King and King, the queen finally has some time for
herself, and everyone lives happily ever after"). While this Dutch import is pointed,
it's nonetheless high-spirited and light-hearted, with entertaining folkloric details
and a satisfying structure. Nijland's mixed-media art combines painterly brush
strokes, texture-heavy collage, and a multitude of figures in quivery childish line;
the result is a joyously informal pageantry, occasionally crowded but more often
enticingly packed, and eminently suitable to this fanciful kingdom where even the
rejected princesses happily attend the royal wedding. This is a sweet and festive
tale that will appeal not only to audiences with a thematic interest but also to
youngsters fond of romance and celebration. DS

tum of urgent but orderly activity, and a pair of line-captioned drawings detail the
smokejumpers' parachuting and ground regalia. The counting format, however,
is often forced: one would hope that an emergency dispatcher would pick up the
phone on fewer than Three rings, and enumerating Five prop blades on the air-
plane adds no pertinent information. Even more problematic is the lack of expla-
nation for the smokejumpers' ground activities: although it should be obvious to
most adults that they are clearing a fire break, the strategy is never clarified within
the text. A cloud of lurid pink "slurry," dropped from another low-flying aircraft,
is also undefined. 
A dense, three-page author's note has the real scoop, but the
presentation will soar over the heads of children drawn to a counting book; parents
had better read the afterward first and brace themselves for a slew of questions. EB

Elmer the duckling doesn't enjoy the same pleasures as the other boy ducklings:
"They boxed while Elmer baked. When they built forts, Elmer made sand castles.
They had a football game, and Elmer put on a puppet show." This doesn't much
trouble the happy-go-lucky Elmer, but stern Papa Duck insists that Elmer try to
be more like the other boys-with disastrous results. Papa changes his tune, how-
ever, when he's injured by a hunter's bullet and survives the winter only because of
Elmer's tender care. The text (based on an animated special) is undoubtedly well
meant, but it's laden with problems that make it unsuccessful as literature and
unlikely to help the kids it's apparently trying to assist. As with many thematically
pioneering titles, this is grimly didactic and old-fashioned in every other way, with
contrivance abounding (Fierstein has to demonize the other ducks to make Elmer's
care of his father uniquely heroic, and every playground veteran will recognize the
unlikelihood of the bully's transformation into admiring friend); the obvious arti-
ficiality of the construct will quite likely make the story rebound against poor
Elmer and perhaps even against his classroom fellows. Cole's acrylic and colored-
pencil illustrations are a little slick, but they add a welcome dose of energy, making
Elmer a sunnily yellow cousin to Daffy with his comically dramatic expressiveness
and tufted head; unfortunately, the sly touches of campy humor (Elmer gleefully
cutting a string of pink paper ducks with hearts or pirouetting about the house in
his frilly apron as he dusts) are likelier to be appreciated by adults than young
audiences. This is a laudable effort, but a sympathetic talk with a supportive adult
is more likely to help than this strained fable. DS

Fisher's creative rurality of phrase (and young Bailey's inventiveness in the face of

illustrative compositions are more unfocused than gloriously chaotic, but Fisher's
deliberately flattened figures with thick edging in lively hues evince a designerly

The baby narrator may be extraordinarily precocious to formulate his/her thoughts
so eloquently, but the adoring observations of preschooler "big brother" are the
perfect foil to Fisher's lovingly staged photographs. "This is my big brother" ac-
companies a photo from a rug-crawler's vantage point: "big brother" is a pair of
untied sneakers and slouchy red socks housing a bandage-embellished pair of shins.
"My big brother feeds me" renders the open-mouthed brother as a background
blur, while the food-laden yellow spoon fairly springs forward in sharp relief. A
game of peekaboo is played out in life-size close-ups, and the final spread ("and he
loves me"), in which the narrator is revealed as a reflection in a toy mirror, again
cleverly employs razor-sharp foreground focus to direct viewers' attention to the
main event. Clearly the siblings' relationship is a bit idealized, and "big brother"
seems to be an ever-available, ever-patient source of entertainment. What little
kid wouldn't want a big guy like this around, though? Family sharing of this title
might even nudge siblings in an amicable direction. EB

A magic hat appears ("one fine day, from out of town, and without any warning at
all") and proceeds to wreak happy havoc with the townsfolk: every time it lands
on someone's head, he or she turns into an animal. The chaos is finally curtailed
by the appearance of a wizard, who retrieves his hat and turns everyone affected
back into themselves: "The toad, the baboon, the bear, and the 'roo,/ And of
course the giraffe (Oh, what a to-do!)/ Turned back into people, dazed and con-
fused,/ Watched by a crowd that was highly amused!" Tusa's line-and-watercolor
illustrations have a homely appeal: the colors are clean, her white space is skillfully
employed, and her characters' faces and body language have a cheerful eloquence
of expression. The story itself does not have quite enough wit to distract from the
unfortunate sing-song quality of the rhyming text, nor does the pace ever achieve
any noticeable momentum, since this is essentially a catalogue of transformation.
Still, there is a chuckle or two in the nonsense magic of Fox's tale, and a skillful
reader-aloud (with, perhaps, hats?) will be able to make this come alive in story-

poor despite owning a dry goods store and a farm, and the mill workers and the
JULY/AUGUST 2002

black tenant farmers face even greater economic hardship. Inspired by her friend
Evette's tales of a journalist aunt, eight-year-old Darby begins to learn-and to
tell-the truth about her community by writing stories for the local newspaper.
Tensions increase when Darby, already flouting convention by her friendship with
African-American Evette, writes a column expressing her growing awareness of
race-based inequalities: "It started by saying how surprised I was to hear that black
people up North lived in nice neighborhoods and that some owned things like
houses and cars. Then I told how I thought it was strange because I'd never seen
such a thing. But it was true, and it seemed funny to me that it could be that way
somewhere else but not in Marlboro County." The newspaper editor initially
rejects the article as "inflammatory" (since, as Evette says, "It's mostly a secret that
blacks can be that way"), but after a crisis of conscience, he publishes the column
and, along with Darby's family, faces down the local representative of the KKK.
While the central plot is purposive (and the focus on the transformation of white
characters entirely conventional), the novel is thick with details of everyday life
culled, according to the author, from oral history interviews. In this context, Darby's
perspective on her friends, her fears, and her enjoyments offers readers a rich and
accessible experience of a minimally reconstructed South in which young white
girls are addressed respectfully as "Miss" but African-American adults seemingly
have only first names. FK

There's a storm coming in the Tetons, and Axel, whose father runs the rock-climbing
school, is distressed to hear that his dog, Grits, is stranded on the mountain. With
his father as support, Axel sets out to rescue Grits even as the storm rages; he
climbs up a vertical face to rescue the panicky pup, hangs on as the storm passes
directly overhead, and then engages in a daring free descent after his rope has been
used to lower his canine buddy. George fills her story with kid-alluring aspects-
a lost dog, a kid at ease on the rocks, a daring rescue, a supportive but very second-
ary parent-and there's more sheer physical action here than in most entry-level
narrations. There's also some contrivance, though (it's not really clear why Axel
wasn't keeping tighter tabs on his dog, and the storm seems like externally applied
suspense), and the text falls oddly silent at the climactic free climb. Minor's fig-
ures (both human and canine) are often strained and awkward, and his textural
dabs and strokes make the rock face look strangely furry. He makes ample use of
dramatic viewpoints on Axel's climb, though, allowing the rock and the sky to
dwarf the youngster as he dangles in midair or glues himself to the mountain face.
There are a lot of adventure-loving kids too young for Hatchet or even Petersen's

simple to complex both in ingredients and process (as with all cookbooks for young

is ranked by level of difficulty (from one to three stars), and preparation times and
serving sizes are clearly marked; in addition, recipes suitable for vegans (no eggs
and no dairy) are indicated with a broccoli sprig. Although this Canadian import
displays the metric measurements first, U.S. standard measurements are provided
immediately following the metric. Safety tips are included in the introduction,
along with brief information about vegetarian nutrition, staples of the vegetarian
kitchen, cooking terms, and utensils. Although this is probably more cookbook

In this sequel to Witch Twins, identical twins Claire and Luna Bundkin are spend-
ing the summer at Camp Bliss, to Claire's delight and Luna's regret. To help the
reluctant Luna, the girls' grandmother has provided her with some Marigold Zest,
an "adventure enhancement" that should liven up any of Luna's activities. Before
Luna can avail herself of the material's magical properties, however, the vial goes
missing, and strange things begin to happen: a disliked counselor gets a bad case of
the clumsies, a campfire singalong gets chummier, even the food gets better. This
is basically your standard camp story-quiet camper (Luna) makes good, outgoing
camper (Claire) makes friends with rival-with a little spell thrown in here and
there. Rogers' spot art perks up the chapter openings, and Griffin (author of
Amandine, BCCB 10/01) slips the magic in with handily understated sleight of
plot that never overwhelms the action. The relationship between the sisters is part

Boy tonight? We never have Boy anymore!" After Father Wolf assures him that he
can have Boy for dinner if he finds one, Little Wolf then pretends to have seen a
boy all ready for the oven ("Boy! Boy! I've just seen a boy in the woods! If we
hurry, we can catch him!") and rejoices when the ensuing boy hunt spoils dinner
(the Wolves break out the snack food, having a quick supper of Chipmunks and
Dip). The parents Wolf catch on to Little Wolfs deception, however, so that
when he spots a troop of Boy Scouts ("Enough to fill our freezer and Auntie's
freezer, too!") his now-truthful cries of "Boy!" are, of course, met with stony indif-
ference. This is an amusing twist, and Hartman wisely doesn't stop there. The

and details (the particularly mischievous scout who marches right through the
Wolves' den under Mother and Father Wolf's oblivious noses will make viewers
howl with laughter), and the borrowed structure works to good advantage. Raglin's
line-rich art employs hatching and crosshatching so generously and evenly that
there's a suggestion of wood engraving, but there's no stiffness, just controlled and
comedic polish in the bug-eyed, early American wolves with their traditional down-
home values and long, toothy snouts. These wolves will give Aesop a run for his

other games of pretend instead. They imagine they are different kinds of trees,
cars, cats, and even "wibbly-wobbly Jell-O," until finally Lily May gets her wish
and the three friends play her favorite game. This is unfortunately short of ten-
sion, reading more like a catalogue of activities than a rollicking playtime story,
and there's not enough payoff to compensate for the lengthy build-up to Lily
May's desired pastime. Nonetheless, Heap's simple text effectively captures the
rhythm of young children's imaginative play. Mixed-media illustrations mimic
child-created art, combining paper collage (including shiny paper for fairy wings)
with crayon scribbles. Visual compositions are active without being too busy, and
the mixed-media effects add significant interest to the simple lines and shapes that
depict button-eyed children playing dress-up. Young audiences won't mind the

adventure (see Blue Avenger Cracks the Code, BCCB 10/00 and The Adventures of

righteous ending. This outing presents Blue with a challenge close to home and
heart: his true love Omaha Nebraska Brown has fallen on financial hard times that
could-gasp!-force her to move away. As Fate would have it, however (unless, of
course, you believe it wouldn't), the cosmic confluence of events offers Blue an
opportunity to earn the requisite few thousand dollars, provided he can withstand
the crushing temptation to beneficently affect a broader range of the needy by
earning a million instead. Along the way he grapples with a doughnut-shop fan-
cier/media mogul, his brother Josh's quest for a class project that involves corn-
starch, a license-plate censor, and his own fully requited (but unfortunately
overchaperoned) passion for Omaha. Howe reprises her previous freewheeling

Hen, Duck, and Goose decide to go on a picnic, filling their basket with berries
(for Hen), apples (for Goose), and pears (for Duck). Spontaneous picnics can be
hard to pull off, however: there's something wrong with every site they find,
nobody wants to be stuck carrying the heavy basket, and finally they're surprised
to find that they've wandered back home and never had their picnic at all. In
typical form, Hutchins has let her audience in on another fact that's going to be a
big surprise to the avian trio: a few hungry varmints have taken a shine to the
basket en route and one by one relieved it of its goodies. This doesn't have the taut
suspense of the classic Rosie's Walk, but instead there's a gleeful collusion between
audience and book (and perhaps audience and bright-eyed mouse, squirrel, and
rabbit) as the hapless fowl remain oblivious to the depredations on their food
supply; in itself, the text is neat and festive, employing lots of enjoyable repetition.
Hutchins' style is its usual blend of simple (in the straightforward outlines of forms
and figures) and decoratively complex (in the elaborate stitchery of lines that pro-
vide textures of fur and wings, in the close-coupled rhythm of stylized fruit-laden
trees), and the contrasting but slightly muted retro palette (with strong emphasis
on green, green everywhere) keeps the design from being overwhelming. The art
doesn't overplay the humorous bits, instead trusting its viewers' ability to get the
joke; the real visual humor lies in the disorganized and heedless picnickers, wan-
dering around in circles, missing what's under their beaks, and finally setting out
once again on a picnic clearly as doomed as the first. Kids will appreciate the
picnic, the dopey birds, and the chance to be know-it-alls. DS

viewers to guess or, more likely, provide their own alternative answer. While the
figures and expressions are sometimes stiffly drafted, there's evident warmth in the
extended African-American family, pleasure in the bucolic setting, and useful am-
biguity about the gender of the bouncy overalled toddler who could easily be boy
or girl. The pastels on dark paper are thick with textures, and there are some
entertaining viewpoints and perspectives (toddler peeking out from behind Daddy's

his text is peppered with likely turns of phrase that fall trippingly from the readal-

personality of the tale; the drafting is sometimes awkward and the figures are in-
consistently sized. The emphatic color contrasts (there's a particular reliance on
orange) are nonetheless galvanizing, and the giants are divertingly gruesome. The

and speculation allow. 9.11.01 attempts more comprehensive coverage, present-
ing a briefer description of the four hijacked flights but lengthier exploration of the
probable roles of Osama bin Laden and Muslim extremists in the attacks. Septem-

Terrorism series and concentrates instead on a narrower account of the day's roil-
ing cascade of events. Wheeler's effort, with its opening double spreads of fleeing
survivors and smoking rubble and its gallery of emotionally charged close-ups,
claims stronger visual appeal. Lalley's readers, on the other hand, are likelier to
come away with a better understanding of how ongoing Afghan politics figures
into the picture and how the domestic aftermath of the attacks includes not only
heroic clean-up efforts, but also the questionable curtailment of certain civil rights.
Each volume could use a bit of editorial polish-Wheeler talks about offices at the
"sight of impact" and passes on a few questionable tidbits as facts (never clearly
supporting her claim for a casualty figure exceeding 5,000, for instance); Lalley's
glossary suggests a mispronunciation for "ref-yuh-GEE" and completely omits all
Arabic terms included within the text. Still, both titles can justly claim their place

This tour of geographical sites and concepts takes readers around the world in
poetry, with poems covering a variety of globally scattered topics, from famous
explorers (Columbus, Magellan) to geographic names (Sandwich Islands, the Red
Sea) to geological features (faults, caves). A few of the poems also teach concepts,
such as "Island Hopping," which defines archipelagoes, or "How to Tell Latitude
from Longitude," which offers a simple device for remembering the difference
between these two kinds of lines: "Lines of latitude/ Have a flatitude/ Longitudi-
nal lines/ Rise like porcupines." The subject matter will attract would-be travelers
and even more teachers, and there are some entries aptly tuned to young readers.
Most poems, however, assume previous knowledge of geography, using jokes and
puns that are likely to go over the heads of young readers without adult assistance.
Lewis' language is cluttered with choppy lines ("The Arctic is water all covered
with ice. / Antarctica? Land (frozen paradise)") and forced rhyme schemes, and the
verses are unfortunately afflicted with looming scansion traps that will require
careful negotiation during readalouds. Jay uses her signature craquelure textures
and sepia-toned palette for the images of travelers and for landscapes that resemble
old maps, making them slightly surreal and deftly complementing the poetic theme.
Despite its flaws, this collection could be useful as supplemental classroom mate-
rial for units dealing with geography. KM

When Bel finds a photograph of her great-grandmother Bea, she's immediately

intrigued. Her fascination becomes even more intense when she begins to hear
Bea in her thoughts, talking and offering opinions on events in Bel's life (especially
Bel's relationship with Sergio, her "crush"). The addition of a third voice-that of
Bel's own great-granddaughter from the future-compels the plucky Bel to find
her own voice and her own way in the day-to-day decisions she must make. First
published in Brazil in 1982, this is an airy and humorous story; Bel's narration has
genuine charm, and her delighted and affectionate acceptance of her great-
grandmother's presence makes it easy for readers to go along with the idea.
Machado, recent winner of the Hans Christian Andersen award, sets up her premise
quickly and easily, plunging right into the happy events of Bel's life. The contriv-
ance becomes excessive with the addition of the third voice, however, and the
conclusion (Bel, her great-grandmother, and her great-granddaughter recognize
that they are all part of the braid of past, present, and future) is too heavily purpo-
sive for the otherwise breezy story. Middle-graders will still enjoy the setup, and
Bel and her relatives are a trio worth knowing. The springy lines of Merola's ink
illustrations evince the same high spirits as the text. JMD

Twelve-year-old Rebecca shares a room with four aunts (according to the helpfully
included family tree, her mother is the eldest of the thirteen children) and her
younger sister-until a fire destroys their Oxbow, Saskatchewan farmhouse and
barn, forcing the extended family to move to even more cramped quarters, joining
other first-generation immigrants in 1910 Winnipeg. Things get worse: because
her father can't find acceptable work, Rebecca and her siblings are placed in foster
care through the Hebrew Sick Benefit Society; while her younger brother and
sister are appropriately placed in the home of observant Jews, shy Rebecca goes to
live with Ukrainian Christians. There she finds a kindly mother, an anti-Semitic
father and brother, and, unexpectedly, a friend in Sophie, the daughter of the
house-a seeming good that ultimately forces Rebecca to wrestle with the compet-
ing demands of clan loyalty and intercultural friendship. Though a bit flat at
times, this is a consistently thoughtful novel, with Rebecca's dilemma realistically
remaining a problem even though almost everyone involved sees the artificiality of
the lines that are being drawn in the sand; her growing understanding of indi-
vidual moral responsibility is credibly depicted. This sophisticated exploration of
free will vs. determinism manages to rub the tarnish off the golden rule and make
it shine. FK

Gou Haoyou must take up the only trade available to him to support his widowed

compounded by the family patriarch's insistence that the widow marry her husband's
murderer, and Haoyou is driven in desperation to offer his services to mysterious

circus master, the Great Miao, as a kite rider. Haoyou masters the sky and comes
to love the nauseating yet exhilarating experience of flight. His career prospers,
but collateral dramas intensify, as Miao proves to be a rebel against the great Kublai
Khan, greedy relatives appear to cash in on his fortune, and his mother is far from
safe. McCaughrean's construction of the kite rider is (according to closing notes)
more suggested by than based on actual thirteenth-century Chinese "wind testing"
practices, and her characters miraculously arrive at their stage marks just in time to
impel the plot along. Nonetheless, the solid, old-fashioned melodrama is exquis-

Seven-year-old Roberta doesn't want to leave her mother to go "Down South" to
visit her loving grandparents on their farm in North Carolina; she's particularly
resentful that what's driving her away is her mother's pregnancy (Mama's been
confined to bed). The visit proves largely enjoyable-Roberta makes some new
friends, participates in chores on the farm, and travels into town-but she's nagged
throughout by her anxiety about the coming interloper, an anxiety reflected in her
awkward interactions with a friend's baby brother. Grandpa offers Roberta a more
positive way to think about the ways family circles grow and change, but it's a scare
at the Children's Day picnic (her friend Jimmy falls in a well) that seems finally to
do the trick. This is an affectionate historical celebration (the novel's set in 1946)
of a close African-American family and a tight southern community, and there's a
great deal of charm in its richly textured evocation of country life. Unfortunately,
there's period atmosphere rather than structure, so that Roberta's experiences sim-
ply aggregate with little emphasis or shaping, and the overlay of psychology is both
didactic and too obliquely handled for its audience (who may share Roberta's un-
answered questions about how the baby will come out of Mama). The book's
solid warmth is emphasized and extended by Evans' sharp-edged and quirky pen-
cil drawings, which invite readers to meet Roberta's friends and relations and share
their old-fashioned pleasures. Though a bit lacking in impact, this is ultimately a
wide-eyed story about a summer visit to the farm, suitable for reading aloud to
dreamy listeners and handing to youngsters who may have their own country vaca-
tions to relate. FK

Six stories (with McKinley and Dickinson alternating authorial turns) feature vari-
ous bodies of water, the denizens that dwell within them, and the land-bound folk
who deal with both. Dickinson's tales lean toward fairy-tale anthropology while
McKinley's incline to high fantasy, but all are effectively supernatural, no matter
where they're set. In Dickinson's opening story, set in a restrained, Calvinist-like
community, Pitiable Naismith learns a secret "Mermaid's Song" passed down from
her grandmother that helps her save a stranded merchild, along with herself.
McKinley's opening tale is a romance in which a wealthy but sheltered girl, be-

trayed by her unworthy fiance, finds true love with "The Sea-King's Son." Other
tales focus on man-beast opposition (Dickinson's "Sea-Serpent" and "Kraken"),
legendary water creatures (McKinley's "Water Horse"), and water's mysterious
powers (McKinley's "A Pool in the Desert"). Despite their brevity, the entries
manage to establish mood, structure, and logic; each tale has a richly textured
sense of place, an environmental backdrop against which characters play out their
destinies. The stories rise and fall like waves, first high fantasy, then earthy con-
flict, but they're always intriguing and ultimately satisfying. The cover, which fea-
tures an unearthly finned creature holding a ball of air, will draw readers into the

struggling with the regular fifth grade ("the big leagues") after being in Special

Piggy learns from Mrs. Farmer Todd how to make fabulous pancakes with a spe-

Six years old when he and his parents cross the Rio Grande from Mexico, Miguel
Rivera is now a third-grader living with his family in El Paso, where his family
works long hours and fears the INS and Miguel deals with racist class bully Joey
Jeter Cortes, the son of an American border guard. Fear of deportation drives
Miguel's mother to pack up Miguel and his siblings (an adopted sister, and twins
born in the United States) and follow her husband to Santa Fe, where he has gone
to pursue a new job. Once in Santa Fe, however, the family is unable to find Mr.
Rivera, and Miguel's mother shoulders the responsibility of caring for her children
and earning a living alone. Miguel misses his father desperately, battles the bullies
in his class (including Joey Jeter, who has moved to Santa Fe), and meets Isabel, a
Mexican-American teenager who introduces him to the Palace of the Governors
and to the contributions Mexicans have made to New Mexican and American
culture. There are some good messages here: illegal immigrants are often moti-
vated by desperate desire for a better life, strong family ties are beneficial, and
immigrants legal and otherwise contribute to the cultural fabric of the United
States. The family's struggle in El Paso is depicted with a quiet dignity; Miguel's
relationship with his parents and sisters is treated with respect, and the disappear-
ance of Miguel's father is heartbreakingly limned. The messages are unsubtle and
contrived, however, especially in the Santa Fe portion of the text: Miguel discov-
ers pride in his heritage in the Palace of Governors, his father is miraculously
returned to his family, and Joey Jeter's point of view is changed by a school play
about bullying. 
For less didactic insight into the politics and plight of illegal
immigrants, see Buss' Journey of the Sparrow (BCCB 1/92) or Jiminez' The Cir-
cuit, but those readers able to leap from moment to moment may find themselves
involved in Miguel's life. Ancona's wiry sketches display a high energy and inten-

Sixteen-year-old Jimmy is given a choice by the judge: go to juvenile hall or spend
six months in a mentoring program. Opting for the second, he finds himself
working alongside another juvenile offender, Kevin, in the Harlem barbershop of
Mr. Duke Wilson, listening to the wisdom of Duke and his cronies as various
customers and neighborhood folk pass under their scrutiny. Jimmy is resistant,
disliking the men's persistent lectures ("They didn't understand what being young
JULY/AUGUST 2002 
* 413
was all about. Maybe they knew once, but they had definitely forgotten some-
where along the way"), but he sticks it out. Eventually he begins to appreciate
Duke's efforts ("I saw he was just trying to be in my corner and helping me to get
my stuff correct. You don't goof on somebody like that"), even as he realizes that
taking the path of adulthood and responsibility isn't easy. This is a fairly preachy
narrative, with page after page repeatedly making the point that people-even
young people-must be active participants in their own destiny or have no one to
blame but themselves; between the reliance on speeches and the barbershop set-
ting, the proceedings are somewhat static, and the book's end is equivocal. Myers'
comfortable style makes the lessons go down easily, however, and the message is
one that young people may be better able to consider from a favorite author than
from a garden-variety parent. The casual camaraderie of the barbershop, where
philosophy comes as naturally as a short back and sides, is warmly conveyed, and
the diverse array of characters livens up the environment as well as providing teach-
able moments for Duke. It's probably too much to hope for that Jimmy's example
of listening to the wisdom of his elders will suffice to convince readers to do the
same, but Myers has the ear of a lot of teenagers; maybe they'll at least listen to
him. Bandsuch's orderly, lightly sketched line drawings enhance the book's acces-
sibility. DS

Teenage Donata, the daughter of a noble in seventeenth-century Venice, wants
more than an arranged marriage or a sheltered convent life, so she dresses as a boy
to roam the alleys and canals in search of adventures she can use as fodder for
stories to tell her dutiful but bored sisters. An unlikely turn of events finds Donata
and her twin sister Laura taking lessons with their brothers; after proving to be a
gifted scholar, Donata denounces herself to Venice's ruling court, gets out of her
planned marriage (twin sister Laura is to become the willing bride), and acquires
her father's permission to study at the university and become a tutor. Venice is a
romantic setting for historical drama, and this has both intriguing historical tidbits
and a sympathetic heroine in Donata. Unfortunately, the historical facts aren't
blended well into the story, and good intentions tend to run roughshod over his-
torical fidelity in both Donata's behavior and in the male characters' response to
her; nor does the stately pace help pull things together. Still, those readers with a
taste for costume drama and tradition-bucking heroines may find their hunger
appeased here. An appended author's note discusses the first Venetian woman
scholar ever to be awarded a doctoral degree from the University of Padua. JMD

In 1974, two farmers in China's Lintong County made a sensational historical
find when their digging turned up the head of a "pottery man"; subsequent ar-
chaeological exploration, still continuing, has revealed an elaborate army of over
7,500 terracotta men, installed in pits by the first emperor of China over two
millennia ago. This is the kind of discovery of which budding (and other) archae-
ologists dream, and the still, watchful visages of the unearthed soldiers (there are
414 
* THE BULLETIN
some judiciously chosen close-up portraits) add a slightly creepy and fantastical
touch that spices up the account. O'Connor capably touches on early Chinese
history, describing the reign and beliefs of Emperor Qin Shihuang that may have
prompted his creation of this army, but she never allows the Emperor to over-
shadow his surprise legacy. Discussion of the terracotta army itself includes analy-
sis of its making ("Hundreds of craftsmen from all over the empire spent more
than ten years in workshops set up near the pits creating the warriors") and the
theories about its arrangement ("Archeologists think that Pit 3 represents army
headquarters"), as well as dashes of military history ("By the time of the first em-
peror, soldiers on horseback were replacing war chariots"). Diagrams and com-
puter-assisted images help convey the configuration and original appearance of the
underground warriors, since excavation unfortunately tends to result in the re-
moval of their paint. The gloss of mystery is finish enough, however ("What is the
terracotta army guarding so steadfastly? ... The answer is that nobody knows"),
and this will catch the imagination of a wide range of readers. The appended
author's note describes the contradictions and uncertainties in the historical record;

The bonds that are forged between people and their childhood security objects are
often emotional and enduring, as this unique photoessay clearly demonstrates.
Each spread features a large black-and-white photograph of a person with his or
her comfort object along with the object's name and the name and age of its owner.
Also included is anecdotal information (often humorous or poignant) about the
object from the owner's perspective: "I like the fuzzy threads to snuggle with, and
the stringy ones are good for chewing," says one girl of her blanket. Udesen's
highly expressive photographs are richly varied in terms of lighting, contrast, and
composition (one full-page close-up shows two little hands rubbing a comforter;
another is shot at floor level as an adult subject and his teddy bear stand on their
heads). There's a pleasantly diverse range of subjects, too, in terms of age (eigh-
teen months to fifty years old), gender (men as well as young girls are shown with
dolls and stuffed animals), and situation (an adopted child, a seriously ill child, a
college student, a journalist). Though this may draw adults more readily than chil-
dren, readers with strong attachments to their own comfort objects will likely find
these personal images and stories both reassuring (maybe they don'thave to give up
their "blankies" after all) and entertaining. This unusual title could serve as a
springboard for similar projects in classrooms or for parent-child reminiscing; it
would also be a natural partner to Margery Williams' The Velveteen Rabbit or

blissful musical time is had by all, and Mavis even gets to go on a little interplan-

ing: the skewering of the health industry and the media fascination with body
image is disappointingly absent, replaced by a rather lightweight plot and low-cal
humor. Still, Pinkwater does know how to move a plot along, and readers who
drop in for a quick bite won't be sorry, even if they're hungry again an hour later.

to the team. Should Flint let him go, and, if so, whom to replace him with? The

remaining possibility, Summerfield, is not only a girl, she's a girl who doesn't
shave her legs, a detail that seems insurmountable to Beaterson and Deshutsis,
despite the fact that she's the best choice. This is a perceptive picture of guyhood,
with authentic banter, hanging out, and even angst, and teens will relate to the
exploration of the ethics of friendship. This isn't up to some of Powell's previous
novels (such as Tribute to Another DeadRock Star, BCCB 4/99), however: the plot
meanders and the pace is slow, and despite McCallister's constant agonizing, his
sudden dumping of Savage is unforeshadowed and abrupt. Nonetheless, readers

In a land populated by humans and Half-Creatures (mer-beings, centaurs, etc.),
the Singers live on an island of amplifying blue stone and maintain order through
special songs that psychically effect behavior; one of their sacred duties is to keep
the Half-Creatures from being abused by decadent or stupid humans. In Song
Quest (first published in Britain in 1999), the merlees (merpeople) are being slaugh-

Khiz crystal to kill his lord, defeat the Singers, and rule the world. Only Rialle and

Khizpriest and the end of the world's balance. In Crystal Mask, Renn, the son of
Rialle, and the centaur-raised Shaiala are unwillingly drawn into the machinations
of Frazhin, who has regained his power in the intervening twenty years and has

and the Half-Creatures are awkward), and the children remain the focus, with the
grownups figuring in but never dominating the action. Young readers will also
warm to the concrete nature of the protagonists' quests to save family and friends,
and Roberts (author of Spellfall, BCCB 2/02) offers plenty of grand sweep in the
traditional heroic-journey plots. Combine a quick booktalk with a flash of this
sharp cover art, and you have a new fantasy series to put right up front. Each book
includes a map. JMD

In this fourth and final installment in the Rowan of Rin series (Rowan and the
Keeper ofthe Crystal, BCCB 4/02, etc.), Rowan resolves to rescue his younger sister
Annad after she is kidnapped by Rin's sworn enemies, the Zebak. His quest re-
quires a fellowship of four unlikely companions: Rowan, the uneasy hero; Zeel, a
Zebak adopted by the Travelers, allies of Rin; Allun, part Rin, part Traveler; and
Perlain, a marine-being who cannot live without water. Sheba, the wise but de-
spised witch of Rin, leads the journey, appearing to the four misfits in the flames of
the twigs Rowan burns on their way. On their travels, the companions encounter
a multitude of perils, overcoming them with the aid of their special talents-but
will they be able to rout the Zebak and rescue Annad? The happy ending is fore-
shadowed from the beginning, and the plot pieces fall into place a tad too smoothly
(the vengeful dragon chasing the trespassing Zebak from Rin's sky is just too con-
venient), making this ultimately formulaic and predictable. Readers will still ap-
preciate the action of the chase-and-escapes, and there are not a few chills to be had
from Rodda's creepy atmospherics. JMD

Mr. Freeman in apartment 3D was, by and large, a "mean, unfriendly, nasty"
neighbor, but he was once kind to eleven-year-old Lily, and she was touched by his
devotion to a quartet of loud, stray cats. When he dies, no one in the building
seems willing to take in the perpetually yowling feline foursome, until Lily staunchly
undertakes the job of finding homes for them in just four days, which is all the
time the landlord will allow her before he calls the SPCA. Wisely realizing that "if
you don't have a name, it's hard to get somebody to like you," Lily names each of
the cats, including an uncompromisingly wild, one-eyed black cat ("Leonardo,
after the actor") that seems destined to remain homeless. She manages to find
places for all of the cats except Leonardo, but she eventually comes up with a
solution that satisfies her, the landlord, and Leonardo himself: the one-eyed cat
remains outdoors, showing up as he pleases and allowing Lily to feed and pet him
out on the fire escape. Despite the brevity of the book, Sachs manages unobtru-
sively to describe her characters and her setting with enough specificity to make
them credible and absorbing, and her storytelling is clear and tidy. Lily's youthful

Singer has examined the natural world before, but where Turtle in July (BCCB 9/
89) featured animals, this collection of nineteen poems generally focuses on inani-
mate phenomena such as geology, weather, and seasons. The free-verse lyrics are
delicately spun, offering quiet reflection on caves ("The thing about caves/ is you
go so deep/ inside the earth/ you think that you have left it"-"Caves"), the
prioritization of the prehistoric ("Dinosaurs get all the press... / But before/ way
before reptiles ruled/ other creatures were here"-"Prehistoric Praise"), and slip-
pery conditions ("Out on the street/ Dad windmilled like a slapstick dancer/ Mom
crept like a mincing crab"-"Ice"). Some of the poems offer more elegant beauty
than impact, but there's plenty of reward here for readers of evocative verse (and
for younger listeners, since many of these entries will be splendidly sonorous when
read aloud). The book's format is polished and attractive, with its narrow creamy
pages and artistic but readable font (it's a shame that flimsy paper allows for dis-
ruptive bleed-through of the images); So's ink illustrations show an astonishing
variety of textures, from precise tracery to glimmering gray washes, throughout
evincing a dash and naturalness that usefully complement the poetry. DS

As gimmicky as this title is, it will certainly be welcomed by at least some of the
fans of the author's Victorian spoof series, "A Series of Unfortunate Events." An
obituary for Lemony Snicket (said series' author) is the catalyst for this autobiogra-
phy, written in the vein of "the reports of my death have been greatly exagger-
ated." Bits of photographs, letters, snatches of song lyrics, and seemingly connected
but ultimately random events purport to be the life story of the elusive and verbose
Mr. Snicket. Contradictory declarations and melodramatic language present plots
and counter-plots, conspiracy theories, and secret societies in this mock chronicle
of the supposed author's supposed life. Readers will need to start with the Snicket
novels to appreciate this work, but there's plenty of satiric humor here (including
a parody book jacket for a less traumatic volume), and the cornucopia of elements
will lure Snicket fans. Unfortunately, the cohesive if repetitive plots that drive the
Baudelaire saga are missing here, and while the included bits and pieces of meta-
paraphernalia are cleverly disposed, they are ultimately just too disjointed. Those
who follow the series already know who Snicket really is; it will be a tribute to the
author if his readers are willing to follow the joke this far. JMD

A little boy narrates the activities of a summer week spent with "the aunts," three
loving (and apparently fairly eccentric) women who live on a farm. His chores
(which he likes more than the ones at home) include gathering eggs, slopping the
pig, and watering the runner beans, but "that only takes part of the morning.
What shall we do next?" The aunts decide to make jam, since they're almost out,
but there isn't any suitable fruit available, at least not on their farm. A trip to the
plum tree on the farm down the road (which has a new "bachelor farmer") results
in a wild escape from the farmer, who feels a bit possessive of his ripening plums.
The aunts' matter-of-fact approach to plum-poaching is pretty funny, and the
deliberately understated description of the aunts' escapade will elicit amused giggles;
the pace is slow, however, and the nostalgic adult approach interferes with the
story's momentum. Though the bucolic vistas are enticing, O'Malley's figures are
surprisingly staid, and the palette is subdued where some lively color could provide
a welcome boost. Nonetheless, patient listeners will appreciate the boy's solution
to his aunts' petty larceny (he takes jars of the finished jam and leaves them on the
injured farmer's porch), and they might even be inspired to ask grownup readers
about their own summer memories. JMD

"Thunder/ Lightning/ On the tracks. . . Here comes the train!/ Watch out.
Stand back." The diesel charges up to the station, where a boy and his dad climb
aboard and zoom through the countryside. Past grazing cattle and sheep, over
arched bridges, through sleeping towns and buzzing highways the train sweeps,
while father and son feast in the dining car, wash up in the silver sink, drink from
paper cups, and catch an uneasy catnap. Grandma waves them welcome in the
busy station, then "There it goes/ Our train moves on." Stutson's rhymed text
offers no real plot, just impressions of a nocturnal journey, never lingering long
enough to savor any single experience. Tillotson's hazy, gray-cast illustrations are
infused with nostalgic atmosphere that creates a distance between rider and viewer,
and the misproportioned livestock, fuzzy fields, and toylike buildings suggest a
model-train setup rather than a true adventure. Still, kids lucky enough to have

Narrator Josh is a new kid in Dawson, Alaska, but he's already made a friend,
Gabe, who's eager to fill him in on the local legend: "The old guy living there is
Trapper Jack. He's only got nine toes. The tenth, his left big one, is inside an
empty tobacco tin behind the bar at the Sourdough Saloon.'" Josh wants to see
the evidence, but getting into the barroom is a problem. Trapper Jack himself
offers to do the honors, but just as Josh gets a chance to hold that "something
black and shriveled," a three-legged dog runs off with the goods. Half the legend
remains unproved, but Trapper demonstrates beyond doubt that he has a full
complement of toes-four on one foot and six on the other. Wallace bases his tall
tale on a Yukon barroom prank that involves tossing back a drink with the ampu-
tated toe afloat and "kissing" the toe, as it were. The note explaining this delight-
fully gruesome ritual is probably more fascinating than Wallace's concoction, which
sends the toe off to neverland and obviates any tantalizing residual truth. More-
over, the illustrations' stilted figure drawing makes the boys' changeable features
(rubber-lipped, glassy-eyed, and awash in jaundice yellow) often eerier than the
toe tale itself, though the broad Yukon vistas are satisfyingly bleak against the
textured sweeps of muted color. Tall-tale collections often beg for fresh titles,
though, and errant body parts have their literary following; kids who got a giggle
from DeFelice's Cold Feet (BCCB 11/00) could take a peek. EB

that the clean hands song is sung to a tune all kids and many teachers are too

the construction and operation of the Germostat is confusing at best. Forget also
that anyone who's ever spent time in a classroom knows that airborne germs are
unavoidable, that no one can realistically hope to dodge most common conta-
gions, and that the eradication of all germs is genuinely undesirable as well as
impossible. No matter how important personal hygiene may be, it would be pretty
difficult to point a squeaky-clean finger at a particular individual responsible for a

out: "Ten days! ... She can't go to Bangkok for ten days." When his father points
out that "people do," he replies "People do, ... but not Mommy. Mommy can't
go." Corey is worried about a lot of things (who will make his lunch, tie his shoes,
fix his bear), but his father feels that things are under control: some things Dad
can do ("just like always") and others Corey can even do himself. This is a pur-
pose-built story with few frills and no surprises, but it offers a respectful and well-
paced treatment of separation anxiety, and it's nice to see Mommy and not just
Daddy getting some executive travel now and then. Appealingly off-kilter water-

and finds her own camp pleasures. Wojciechowski carefully crafts her simple story,
overplaying neither Beany's discomfort nor her eventual enjoyment, and there's
reassurance both in the small but frightening obstacles survived (Beany turns up
late to the first breakfast) and in the challenges mastered (with the help of her
counselor, Beany eventually learns to dive). There are also a multitude of warm

When Grandfather Winter retires to his cave, it's time for the Root Children to
awaken: "Mother Earth lights a fire in the hearth, sweeps away the cobwebs, then
throws open the shutters. Young Robin Redbreast lands at the window. 'Root
Children! Root Children!' Young Robin calls. 'Wake up! It's time for the mas-
querade!"' The children wake up, make their blossom costumes, paint bugs bright
colors, and "rush out into the world." They find "kind Aunt Spring," who tells
them, "You are so beautiful. May love and happiness follow wherever you may
bloom." Visits from "jolly Cousin Summer" and "studious Uncle Fall" follow,
until finally Mother Earth calls the children home for their "long winter's nap."
This retelling of Sybille von Olfer's 1906 story is sentimental through and through,
and there are better treatments of the cycle of the seasons than this oversweet
allegory. Oil paintings similar in style to Don Woods' in Heckedy Peg (BCCB 12/
87) appear in panels and double-page spreads decorated with the appropriate sea-
sonal flora and fauna; the drafting of the human figures that dominate the scenes is
disproportionate and the palette is often muddy. A pointedly multicultural cast of
root children frolic in a glamorized bucolic setting; there's a Caucasian predomi-
nance, however, in the seasons and Mother Earth. Song lyrics for the winter lullaby
are included. JMD

Leah Jean Hopper receives the titular box for her tenth birthday; a gift from her
mother's estranged sister, Olivia, the present reconnects the sisters, resulting in a
trip for Leah, her sister, Ruthie, and her mother to visit Olivia in Los Angeles.
There Leah discovers a whole new world-accustomed to her 1950s small-town
life under Jim Crow in Sulphur, Louisiana, she's stunned by the liberty of life in
California ("All I could wonder was why any colored man or woman would ever
go back to the South, below the Mason-Dixon line, after knowing what freedom
felt like"). A second adventure, a trip to New York with Olivia and her husband
opens Leah's and Ruthie's eyes further-and means they're safe when a hurricane
hits Sulphur, killing their parents and many of their friends, and cutting them off
from their old life forever. The novel is shaped by little other than chronology,
and Leah's grief for her parents never really translates to the reader. As a slice of
history and a young girl's reaction to same, however, this is delicately and richly
drawn. There's realism in Leah's largely contented but shadowed and restricted
life in the South and in the details of the wider world she'd never imagined ("Uncle
Bill told me he knowed a colored lady lawyer once") as well as in the tensions
between them; there's also nuance and affection in characterization of major and
even minor characters, such as Olivia's smart and kind husband Bill (a Morehouse

touching story of a girl's survival in the face of family tragedy. DS

advantage of the adults' absence on their honeymoon, kicks Martin out of the
house. "Hungry, homeless, and sweating at age sixteen," Martin heads in his be-

little Red Rock, Idaho. There he moves rapidly and surprisingly from survival
mode to genuine comfort, acquiring a job, lying his way into a place in school,
sleeping in his Jeep in a wilderness camp, and finding romance with his exotic and
charismatic new classmate Diantha Dragon. This is a difficult book to slot but an
easy one to enjoy: while thematically there's survival story, adjustment to familial
change, and a generous helping of coming into one's own, there's pleasure merely
in getting to know Martin through his rueful, deadpan narrative ("I also wondered
if lack of food was affecting my mind, or if it had worked this way before"). The
understated style is both literarily and emotionally accessible, dealing sympatheti-
cally with a boy in genuine and understandable distress ("I was feeling darn good
for Martin J. Miller, which is usually the time someone takes a potshot at me")
while inviting readers put off by more flowery prose and emotion. This is a quirky,

Yolen's retelling of this Russian folktale opens promisingly: "In a certain land, in
a certain kingdom-as they say in old Russia--on the far side of a certain tangled
wood, a garden shimmered like a green jewel. The garden belonged to the wizard
Kotschei the Deathless-so called, it was said, because he could not be killed."
Within the garden is a princess and her nine handmaidens; they are surrounded by
statues of handsome princes, turned to stone in attempts to rescue the women
from the wicked wizard. Prince Ivan, lost in the woods, captures the Firebird,
which gives Ivan a magical feather in exchange for its life. When Ivan stumbles on
the wizard's garden, he engages in battle to save the princess and her maidens; after
he waves the magic feather, the Firebird appears with a golden sword, with which
Ivan kills Kotschei the Deathless and releases the captives. This retelling, based
both on the Russian folktale and Balanchine's version of the popular ballet, is
clumsily wordy, and sections of the tale are unfortunately static. Though the col-
ors have a bright joie de vivre, the visuals are problematic as well: the story of the

folktale dominates the spreads, but a running border on the bottom of the pages
illustrates the plot of the ballet, and the result is crowded and confusing; the awk-

This title has some built-in appeal for balletomanes and folktale enthusiasts, but a
trip to the ballet will likely prove more rewarding. A note on the folktale and the
ballet is appended. JMD

When a boy seeks knowledge from a teacher, the Grand Master sends the boy off
to bring him a small carpet for his work. The boy travels to a carpet maker, who
demands thread; to a spinner who demands goat hair; to a goatkeeper who demands
goats; to a goat-seller who needs a goat pen; to a carpenter who wants a wife; to a
matchmaker who wants knowledge, but not badly enough. The frustrated boy
then discovers a merchant's daughter in love with the wife-seeking carpenter,
whereupon he takes the maiden to the carpenter, who gives him wood for a goat
pen. The goat seller, pleased with the pen, gives the boy the required goats, which
allows the boy to acquire goat hair for the spinner, and so on. Young's retelling of
this Sufi teaching story reads like a standard cumulative tale; in form, it is similar
to traditional tales such as the "The Old Woman and Her Pig." Unfortunately,
the retelling here is a bit choppy, lacking the humor and pointed zest of many
other Sufi tales, and the concluding morals ("Some of the most precious gifts we
receive are those we receive when we are giving" and "Often, knowledge comes to
us when we least expect it"), while not obscure, do not resonate clearly with the
plot. Still, this is an enjoyably structured tale, and the ambivalence of the morals
may provide useful grist for discussion. The collage and watercolor illustrations
fall somewhat short as well: although the characters themselves (formed from
textured paper and textiles, free-floating against speckled paper backgrounds) are
cleverly rendered, overall the images are repetitive and the compositions static. A
cultural note on the origins of the tale is included, but no specific citation is given.

by the initially frightening landlady, Mrs. Yanagi. Chiaki's anxiety begins to make
her ill, and her mother, unable to take more time off from her new job, leaves her

Yanagi's sharing a secret with the little girl: when she, Mrs. Yanagi, dies and goes

the deceased. Encouraged by Mrs. Yanagi, Chiaki begins to write to her dead
father, at first with no more than a brief line or two, but later in letters more
detailed, more urgent, filled with a child's sense of loss and her aching efforts to
understand her grief. The entire story is told in a flashback framed by the now-
grown Chiaki's disappointment with her remarried mother, disillusion with her
chosen career, and heartache over a miscarriage, the result of her first serious love
