Oh, What a Surprise!
written and illustrated by Suzanne Bloom
Kids love surprises—at least, when “surprise” equals “gift”—and little Fox is no 
exception. She’s beside herself with excitement as her big polar bear pal, Bear, is 
working on a surprise present for someone: “I love surprises! Can I see? Can I 
help? Is it for me?” Somewhat dampened by Bear’s answer (“It’s not for you”), the 
fox heads over to see what her friend Goose is doing. Goose is also working on a 
surprise, but to Fox’s chagrin, it is also not for Fox (“But I love surprises,” Fox says 
to herself as she hunkers down sadly in a gift box). She rallies quickly, though, and 
decides to make her own surprise for Bear and Goose by wrapping herself in the 
box. As the time arrives for gift-giving, Fox implores them, “Open me first!” and 
Goose barely touches the gift box’s top before Fox ecstatically leaps out in a shower 
of colored paper hearts: “Ta da! It’s me. For you!” Goose and Bear are delighted with 
Fox’s surprise, but not as delighted as Fox is to discover that her two pals have, in 
fact, been making something for her—a snazzy green vest with two bright buttons. 
Bloom’s text is perfectly age-appropriate both in terms of mechanics 
(straightforward storytelling, simple vocabulary, short sentence structure) and 
content. Little Fox’s eager dialogue and actions are not only amusing, they also skill-
fully mirror the exuberant behavior of youngsters who love the bustle and secrecy 
of holiday gift-giving but find the waiting difficult. The playful back-and-forth 
between the characters is readaloud gold, and the simple text also makes this acces-
sible to kids capable of reading Willems’ Elephant and Piggie series on their own. 
Bloom’s art manages to capture both the chill of winter and the coziness 
of fur, feathers, and friendship through her skillful use of color and texture. The 
warm tones of the chestnut-colored fox and the saturated hues of the handmade gifts 
contrast pleasingly with the deep blues and soft whites of the backgrounds and the 
other animals; looking at Bear’s cobalt blue paw pads, one can almost feel the cold, 
while the dynamic little Fox practically radiates heat in her red-brown fur. Brushy 
lines capably evoke the fluffy fur of Bear’s icy white coat and Fox’s bottle-brush tail, 
and the thickly textured and blended application of the oil pastels lends further 
substance and richness to the figures and backgrounds as well. Little Fox is a lively 
and winsome figure as she capers about in giddy anticipation, tries on the various 
gifts to comic effect, and sadly pulls her pointed ears over her eyes when it seems 
there will be no forthcoming gift for her. Bear and Goose are similarly animated 
in their depictions when interacting with Fox: Bear, for example, must whip the 
scarf he is knitting away from the slightly-too-enthusiastic Fox, while Goose raises 
her wings in sudden joyful surprise when Fox leaps out of her box.

There are numerous uses for this satisfying book: as an easy reader, as a 
readaloud selection for a holiday-themed storytime, as an inspirational springboard 
to a session of homemade gift-making, or as a holiday gift itself (perhaps packaged 
with paper-heart confetti). Readers who latch onto this adorable animal trio via 
this title may want to also seek out Bloom’s previous books about Bear, Goose, 
and Fox (What About Bear?, BCCB 4/10, etc.). No matter how or why it’s read, 
though, kids are likely to clamor at book’s end, like Fox, “Let’s do it again!” (See 
p. 187 for publication information.)

AgArd, John Goldilocks on CCTV; illus. by Satoshi Kitamura. Frances Lincoln, 
2012 64p
ISBN 978-1-84780-183-8 $19.99   
R Gr. 6-10
This collection by noted British poet Agard draws together nearly thirty poems that 
bring a contemporary slant to folkloric themes. Entries feature an updated Puss in 
Boots (“Puss-in-Trainers”), a bitter Rumpelstilskin (“What’s in a Name?”), and a 
Beast resisting transformation (“A Beast and a Beauty”), among others; verse style 
ranges from casually metered rap-style lyrics to quirkily patterned rhymes to crystal-
line free verse, often relying on cheeky British slang. Success levels vary somewhat, 
but all of the poems are enjoyable and some are truly stellar. Readers will relish 
entries such as the lyrical “Wolf” (“Touch my legendary pelt/ and be lost in wonder./ 
Why would I want to put on/ sheep’s clothing?”), the raucous “Hag Chant” (“Who 
cares if your kind call us hags./ Our kind won’t grace your glossy mags”), and the 
poignant “Not My Uncle Bluebeard” (“It was all over the newspapers./ I thought 
there must be some mistake”). Additionally, recitation/performance opportunities 
abound in lively pieces such as “Did You Say Two Ugly Sisters?” and “Pumpkin 
Biker Cinderella.” The design varies throughout, with each spread mirroring the 
featured poem’s tone, and Kitamura’s monochromatic art is impressively versatile, 
featuring not only his familiar scrawled linework but also vivid silhouettes and 
fluidly patterned graphics. The visual and poetic style makes this inviting even to 
usually poetry-shy readers, and it would be a lively complement to Koertge’s recent 
Lies, Knives and Girls in Red Dresses (BCCB 9/12). A table of contents helps with 
finding particular entries.  DS

R 5-8 yrs
Allan Ahlberg riffs on the story of “Goldilocks and the Three Bears,” retelling it 
December 2012 • 185
in seven different, and often comic, variations. He begins with the classic story 
(with some original additions), then segues into “Goldilocks and the 33 Bears,” 
featuring not only mother, father, and two baby bears but also some teenage bears, 
some younger bears, and a “very baby bear.” There’s a sci-fi twist in “Goldilocks 
and the Bliim,” which finds Goldilocks encountering a “pod” of aliens who speak 
an amusing nonsense language; “Goldilocks: The Play” is included as a separate 
but attached booklet; and a horde of fairy tale characters converges in “Goldilocks 
and . . . Everybody.” While some of the variations are more clever than others, the 
book as a whole is lively and humorous; particularly funny are the Bliim’s exclama-
tions (“Who’s been dodderling my spootz?” cries the indignant baby Bliim upon 
discovering his empty “porridge bowl”), some of which may well become class or 
family catchphrases guaranteed to send kids rolling on the floor. Although the small 
size of the pictures makes the title best suited to close-up viewing, they’re quite 
appealing; Jessica Ahlberg’s cheerful line and watercolor illustrations have much 
of the same charm and simple styling as the art of her mother, Janet Ahlberg. Oc-
casional interactive elements, such as a pop-up of the Goldilocks play’s stage set 
and several pull-tabs, encourage further engagement with the text. This would be 
great fun for individual kids or small instructional groups studying folktales, or for 
rib-tickling parent-child bedtime reading.  JH

The treachery of erstwhile Patriot Benedict Arnold is told here from the vantage 
point of twelve-year-old Sophia Calderwood, the fictional sister of a young Patriot 
soldier who dies on a British prison ship in the New York harbor. Witness to the 
hanging of Nathan Hale, Sophia is prepared to despise Lt. John André, a handsome 
British soldier billeted in her home. His flirtatious ways captivate the adolescent, 
though, and it isn’t until he refuses to assist in obtaining her brother’s release from 
prison that Sophia sees André as a suave but ambitious man set on climbing through 
the military ranks. Infuriated by her brother’s subsequent death, Sophia vows to 
avenge him and gets her chance when she’s recruited several years later to spy on 
the British. Positioned as a servant in British headquarters, she uncovers plans for 
the meeting between André and General Arnold that would, in effect, hand over 
West Point to the British; since her contact has been forced into hiding, she must 
bring her information to the fort commander on her own. While Avi performs a 
few narrative contortions to get details unknowable to Sophia to fall into place, the 
fictional core of the story—Sophia’s simultaneous infatuation with and hatred of 
John André—is both engrossing and convincing, and if readers pick up a history 
lesson with the drama, so much the better.  EB

Twelve-year-old Charlie Drinkwater’s body is changing, and not in the way you’d 
think. No, instead of getting zits and facial hair, Charlie develops scales, gills, webbed 
claws, and a giant tail, transforming completely into some sort of mutant dinosaur 
one day in science class. Already a geeky outcast, Charlie is certain his amphibian 
metamorphosis has basically pulled the plug on any chance he has at popularity, but 
186 • The bulleTin
in fact, the cool crowd can’t get enough of his new monstrous persona and invite 
him to join the A-listers’ lunch table. This unfortunately rankles Sam and Lucille, 
Charlie’s fellow nerd pals, as well as Charlie’s older and usually more popular brother 
(who did not inherit the Drinkwater family legacy of mutant dinosaur genes). 
Although the symbolism isn’t subtle, Balaban (better known as a longtime stage 
and screen actor) excels in creating a voice that’s absolutely spot-on for a tween boy 
completely distraught by the changes in his body and totally unprepared to deal 
with the emotional consequence of his new status. Charlie’s observations of the 
social dynamics of middle-school life are rife with horror-movie references and wry 
witticisms, and although he gets swept up in the possibility of being popular, he 
never loses his sense of humor. Rash’s occasional cartoony illustrations match the 
text’s playful tone—the scene in which the bespectacled lizard-like form of Charlie 
attempts to get into his mother’s pick-up is particular amusing. While Charlie’s 
amphibian/reptile mashup won’t be found in any biology textbook, readers will 
forgive his scientific implausibility and readily relate to his bewilderment both at 
his own body and its place in the world.  KQG

A boy falls asleep listening to his mother read aloud his favorite book about a hi-
bernating black bear in this somnolent and cozy meta-narrative. The leisurely pace 
suits the story’s bedtime setting, as does the quiet voice of the narrative. Banks also 
ably captures the physical pleasures—touching the edges and pages of a favorite 
book, looking for hidden details in illustrations, leaning against one’s mother while 
she reads aloud—of sharing a beloved book together before bed: “The boy held 
the book. He listened to the sound the pages made when he turned them back and 
forth. ‘Shh,’ he said to the sleeping bear.” This story may have more resonance for 
the adult reading it aloud than the child listening to it, but many kids will relate 
to the familiar delight of hearing a favorite book read to them again and again. 
Hallensleben’s paintings add further substance and warmth, with their heavy 
brushstrokes of burnished gold, red, and brown set off by icy blue and white tones 
that emphasize the cold of the hibernating bear’s story. The snug depiction of the 
almost stuffed-animal-like black bear asleep in his den and the contrast between the 
bear’s cold winter and the boy’s warm bed will engage viewers just as it clearly does 
the protagonist. This would of course make a fine bedtime story; it might also be 
interesting to use as a catalyst for discussion about the love of books and reading.  JH

At seven, Princess Violet stumbles across a forbidden book in a hidden room of 
her Andulan castle and accidentally awakens a long-forgotten evil. The Thirteenth 
God, however, is a patient one, and he bides his time until Violet is an adolescent, 
plagued by insecurities and lost in grief for her dead mother, to persuade the girl 
to invite him fully into her world with a promise to make her beautiful and restore 
her mother. Of course, the trickster god has no such intentions, and when Violet 
December 2012 • 187
realizes she has allowed chaos into her kingdom, she is helped by a stable boy, a few 
fey folk, and an aging dragon to right her wrongs and save their world. Narrated 
by Cassian, Andulan’s most famous storyteller, Violet’s tale has a quiet, folkloric 
feel, punctuated with moments of bittersweet poignancy. Violet herself is far from 
the genre’s usual plucky princess—driven as much by her feelings of inadequacy as 
she is by her sorrow, she is the picture of a little girl lost who mistakes a villain for 
a savior. Her self doubt will ring true to tweens just recognizing their own limita-
tions while her eventual triumph will make them cheer, even as they are forced 
to consider the unavoidable damage that her actions cause. The Thirteenth God 
is a formidable opponent, and the mythology that Barnhill constructs around his 
origin is impressively detailed, adding to the feeling that this is only one of many 
stories to come from this realm. While Bruno’s black and white illustrations are 
sometimes too stiff for Barnhill’s fluid prose, the more detailed scenes echo the 
fairy-tale like quality of the story.  KQG

When Corey and his family decide to get a puppy, they end up with Mister Mosely 
(whose name comes from the fact that he’s “mostly” white), who turns out to be 
a big gangling goof and the heart of Corey’s family. Each short chapter focuses on 
something special about Mister Mosely—a characteristic he had (a phobia about 
the family’s huge stuffed Pink Panther toy) or a memorable Mosely event (when he 
became anxiously solicitous of Corey’s mom—who, it turned out, was pregnant), 
finishing with a cliff-hanging tease for the next chapter. The episodic structure, 
Corey’s accessible narration, and the appealing subject make this useful for read-
ing aloud as well as reading alone. There’s definitely a touch of elegy throughout 
that foreshadows the sad conclusion from the beginning, and the overall story of 
a dog well loved is an effective tearjerker. Australian author Bauer has a jovial old-
school approach, with boy and dog running genteelly at large and the occasional 
bit of fisticuffs part of the landscape, but he’s got a contemporary sensibility in the 
underlying story of a family under considerable strain when the breadwinner loses 
his job and a baby’s on the way. It’s genre fiction, but it’s executed well and the 
genre is popular for a reason, so be prepared with Kleenex for kids weeping over 
the wonderful Mister Mosely.  DS

Bucknell and Monti attempt to confront the limited multicultural presence in sci-
ence fiction for young people. The result is a compelling mixture of stories with a 
188 • The bulleTin
diverse cast of characters from a variety of family backgrounds, including African, 
Chinese, Indian, Native American, and mixed heritages. Some offerings speak 
directly to themes of race, diversity, and identity, including Ursula LeGuin’s tale of 
alien anthropology, Ken Liu’s account of human-based computation’s reliance on 
the exploitation of child workers in developing nations, and K. Tempest Bradford’s 
story of a girl born out of time whose shifts in parentage affect her understanding of 
her own racial identity. Settings range from near-future possibilities to far-off times, 
and the young heroes and heroines battle everything from robots and undead Norse 
soldiers to political dictators and corporate executives. Nearly all entries involve 
a young person striving to take control of their situation to save themselves, their 
families, their communities, or their worlds, but endings vary from the exceedingly 
bleak to the guardedly hopeful. The collection has broad reader appeal with works 
from well-known stars like Ursula K. LeGuin, recognizable young adult authors 
like Malinda Lo and Paolo Bacigalupi, and crossover adult writers such as Daniel 
H. Wilson, as well as a variety of established science fiction writers who are new to 
the young adult genre. Fans will enjoy reading their favorite writers in short form,

In Pathfinder (BCCB 12/10), precocious young Rigg and his friends escaped a 
hostile army by finding a loophole (time travel) that allowed them to pass through 
the mysterious Wall that segments their world into nineteen parts. Each “Wallfold” 
represents a different evolution of passengers from a spaceship that carried human 
settlers to the planet, accidentally sent them back eleven thousand years in time, 
and created nineteen replications of the same ship. Now Rigg and co., guided by 
the “expendable” Vadesh (an enigmatic robot who has guided human progress from 
the beginning), try to piece together the secrets of this world before a new wave 
of human settlers reaches the planet—and causes their destruction. Lacking the 
straightforward quest and coming-of-age structure of the first book, Ruins instead 
dives deeply into explanations and philosophy at times; fortunately, the world 
itself is still intriguing enough to hold interest on its own terms, and the thought-
provoking, impeccably developed particularities of the various parallel worlds that 
have grown up on this planet are reminiscent of those featured in Pullman’s His 
Dark Materials series. Readers may also appreciate the Shakespearean scope of the 
resentments and power struggles brewing among the company as they work through 
issues of succession, free will, and the nature of humanity in a series of stage-ready 
dialogues. Adding issues of genetic engineering and colonization to the already 
complex thematic backdrop, this is a sci-fi fan’s science fiction epic, reveling in 
the possibilities of scientific advancement and exploring their consequences with 
a palpable and contagious fascination.  CG

Thrilled to be away from home on a school-club ski trip, sixteen-year-old Cassidy 
“Sid” Murphy hopes to get a little crazy on the slopes with her friends and maybe 
to find a little unchaperoned romance. When a ski-lift flirtation with an older guy 
leads to an invitation to an after-curfew party, Sid thinks she may have gotten 
everything she wanted. Instead she wakes up alone and groggy, with only vague 
memories of the rape she endured. Rather than admit what happened to her friends, 
family, or even herself, Sid buries the horror beneath layers of guilt. Unable to face 
the life she had before the rape, she isolates herself physically and emotionally, and 
her attempts to cope lead to bulimia and excessive exercise. Spending time with 
supposed pot-head Corey Livingston allows Sid to begin emerging from her self-
protective shell, and an unexpected event forces her to face what happened and 
finally admit the truth. The strength of this novel lies in the emotionally genuine 
portrayal of Sid, whose voice is witty, lively, and strong, and who remains likable 
despite her self-loathing. Her deeply personal narrative manages to make her silence 
understandable even as it is frustrating. As a romantic hero, Corey is almost too 
perfect to be real in his unwavering adoration, but he is sure to produce his fair 
share of wistful sighs from readers as he stands by Sid through the mood swings 
and frequent breakdowns that he does not understand. The text handles the rape 
itself with sensitivity; it communicates what happens with no specifics or details 
and it moves, like Sid’s hazy memory, from drugged drink to the morning after. 
Readers looking for a heart-wrenching, poignant, but ultimately hopeful story of 
a girl facing the aftermath of personal trauma in the spirit of Anderson’s Speak 
(BCCB 10/99) and Asher’s Thirteen Reasons Why (BCCB 11/07) will embrace this 
well-crafted emotional journey.  AM

On the luxurious island of Demesne, there are beautiful, emotionless clones for 
everything—cleaning, companionship, factory work—all created from Firsts who 
had to die in order for them to exist. Elysia is a beta, part of a test line of cloned 
teenagers (previously assumed to be too unstable for cloning), and she’s bought by 
the Governor’s wife to be a surrogate daughter (a role with plenty of creepy Stepford 
overtones). Through her new siblings and fellow clones, she starts to learn about 
the wider world and her place in it—and also begins to develop actual feelings and 
even memories of her First. Meanwhile, she gets to know gorgeous surfer Tahir 
and comes to realize that he, too, is a clone, illegally created by his parents when 
First Tahir died a year earlier. Cohn introduces readers to a world brimming with 
excess, hypocrisy, and chilling expediencies through Elysia’s blinkered eyes, reveal-
ing layer after new layer of horror as Elysia probes ever-deeper into the mystery of 
her existence. The time-honored sci-fi trope of a manufactured being striving to 
become more human is powerfully reimagined here, and Elysia’s literalism as she 
navigates this disturbingly familiar future underscores her innocence while adding 
an edge of humor to the social critique. The meditations on bioethics and the nature 
of humanity make this a strong complement to Mandanna’s recent The Lost Girl

Skinny’s relentless assault. Even Ever’s faithful and encouraging best friend, Rat, is 
no match for Skinny’s negative hold on Ever’s sense of self-worth. Ever alternates 
between accepting Skinny’s valuations and blaming herself for overeating, and 
rejecting Skinny by claiming she can’t help her weight, thus creating a credibly 
conflicted inner monologue. When Ever decides to undergo gastric-bypass surgery, 
Rat makes her recovery his personal project, and things go well despite the risks. 
She even discovers an unlikely ally in her stepsister, Briella, whom she’d always 
kept at arm’s length with snarky comments. Ever experiences a range of emotions 
as her classmates suddenly take an interest in her; even the queen bee sees her as a 
portfolio piece for her career as stylist and makeover expert. Mostly, though, Ever 
grows to understand that it was Skinny who was keeping her from having friends 
all along, rather than her weight, as person after person asks her why she was so 
distant to them when she was heavy. Their reactions, and Ever’s epiphany, are un-
fortunately simplistic and contrived, and the romantic arc with Rat is likewise pat 
and predictable. Nonetheless, Ever’s battles with Skinny will strike a resounding 
chord with many readers whose negative self-talk is the loudest voice they hear.  KC

A large appetite for sex and shoplifting coupled with an anorexically insufficient 
appetite for food lands Greer at McCracken Hill, a co-ed combination reform 
school/rehabilitation center for kids whose parents are wealthy enough not to have 
to deal with them at home anymore. Alienated and lonely at first, she warms to a 
hunky recovering alcoholic named Addison, whose charisma and stunning good 
looks have garnered him a loyal set of friends who welcome her as one of their 
own. With Addison, however, also comes his AA sponsor, an older man named 
Joshua, who has an almost hypnotic hold over Addison. Addison has implicit faith 
in Joshua’s offbeat wisdom, but Greer senses a sinister aspect to their relationship. 
When Joshua convinces their group of friends to spend the weekend at nearby 
cabin, it becomes clear that Joshua is either running a scam or trying to start a 
cult; either way, Addison is fully invested in whatever game Joshua is playing, and 
Greer knows that she has to tread carefully or risk losing him. Corrigan serves up a 
psychologically complex and devastatingly credible tale of exploitation and betrayal 
among a particularly vulnerable set of teens. As crudely manipulative as Joshua is, 
there is no clear villain in the end apart from their own brokenness; by the time 
Greer has sorted out Joshua’s motives and broken the spell he’s tried to cast over 
her, readers will find pity complicating their condemnation of Joshua’s undeniably

the boy she loves.  KC

Everything changes after Vinnie turns fifteen—his parents divorce, his mother 
falls for his gym teacher, and they move out of the city to Long Island. The first 
good thing about Vinnie’s new living situation is his beautiful, popular next-door 
neighbor, Patsy. When a lucky accident gets him her unlisted phone number (in 
1977, the only non face-to-face way to contact her), he calls her but panics, hang-
ing up wordlessly several times and concluding with an obscene invitation. He 
then begins the habit of secretly and anonymously calling her every night, and the 
two develop a strange communication, contentious but also intimate. Meanwhile, 
during the day, Vinnie tries to navigate his new school, acquiring an entirely dif-
ferent, on-again off-again daytime friendship with Patsy as he watches her engage 
in a relationship with a bullying football player. Couloumbis writes with fluid and 
tender beauty about a kid who’s hoping he can just pretend to be who he wants 
to be and ends up finding himself on the way. The book manages to move him 
plausibly from borderline creepy to perceptive and even honorable in his relation-
ship with Patsy, who begins pouring out her secrets to her midnight confidant. The 
characters, often drawn with a few telling strokes, are believably complex, especially 
Vinnie’s new stepdad, a nice if jock-ish guy who hasn’t quite realized what he’s got 
himself into but is up for the challenge, and who proves eventually to be genuinely 
invested in Vinnie as well. There’s nothing period about this save the technology, 
so contemporary readers won’t find the era an obstacle to understanding Vinnie’s 
urge to reshape himself.  DS

Worn down after years of being the bullying target of Macie and her crew, Leslie 
commits suicide. Jake, the boy who has tried for years to convince her that he 
loves her, is devastated by her death, as is Beth, who participated in the bullying 
because she didn’t want anyone to know that she, too, was in love with Leslie. 
The other girls, goaded by a thoroughly unrepentant Macie, at first disavow any 
responsibility. In fact, student council president Macie turns Leslie’s suicide to her 
personal advantage by springing into action, setting up support groups and giving 
speeches to the press about the tragedy and selfishness of teen suicide. A pending 
civil lawsuit forces the girls to reflect on their behavior until finally Macie is the 
only one keeping up a pretense of innocence, a move that ultimately works when 
her state senator father convinces Leslie’s parents to drop the suit in exchange for a 
profitable business deal. Macie and her father are thoroughly despicable, so much so 
that they come across as caricatures rather than credible characters, and the power

Born into a family of talented burglars, forgers, and pickpockets, twelve-year-old 
Jaxter Grimjinx is horrified when his first solo attempt at burglary results in a di-
sastrous fire and the arrest of his family; worse still, he’s now involved in a prophecy 
that places the entire village of Vengekeep in danger and casts his family in the 
unwanted role of town saviors. Given the chance to test his own gifts out of the 
shadow of his family, Jaxter sets off with new friend Callie at his side. Together they 
tackle errant sages and spiderbats, and they engage in an intricate con of their own 
in an effort to save their town and their loved ones before the worst parts of the 
prophecy come true. The result is a charming story that’s at times laugh-out-loud 
funny but also a satisfying fantasy, offering a magical world and sometimes hap-
less hero that will strike a chord with fans of the first volumes of the Harry Potter 
series. Jaxter’s honest, self-deprecating narration draws readers into his personal 
journey, keeping them at the edge of their seats while lending the story emotional 
heft. Callie is a daring heroine in her own right, the perfect partner in crime and 
valor for the sometimes-timid Jaxter. A vast network of well-drawn characters, 
including Jaxter’s endearing family, quirky townspeople, and multiple allies and

When suicide traps her best friend in the nightmarish purgatory known as the

from her own tortured dreams and with self-defense skills from years of surviving

The imposing, gothic Darkwater Hall was the prized possession of the Trevelyan 
family until Sarah’s drunkard of a grandfather gambled the family’s estate and wealth 
away to Lord Azreal. Years later, Sarah, now sixteen, supports her family through 
menial labor until Lord Azreal returns to her Victorian village to make her an of-
fer she can’t refuse: Azreal will give her one hundred years of wealth, luxury, and 
knowledge, but at the end of a century her soul will be his. Fast-forward several 
decades again and the time of reckoning is at hand: Sarah returns to Darkwater 
Hall prepared to pay her due, but she is disturbed when she finds Azreal making 
yet another bargain, this time with fifteen-year-old Tom, who is haunted by the 
ghost of his dead twin brother. Darkly atmospheric, this Faustian update is both 
compelling and accessible with an ending that interrogates notions of good and evil 
without belaboring the point. The characters aren’t deep, but the premise is folkloric 
enough that it’s appropriate that they’re archetypal rather than dimensional; the 
addition of Tom’s story brings modernity that will draw in contemporary readers. 
Most intriguing, however, is Azreal himself, a figure that by the end most readers 
will realize is neither entirely bad nor decidedly good. In fact, the ambiguous con-
clusion offers up two very different possibilities in regards to his character, and one 
reading has him on the side of the angels despite his seemingly cruel means. Fisher’s 
evocative prose easily creates a perfectly crafted gothic backdrop to this morality 
tale, and readers will find this slim but provocative novel an ideal companion for 
a gloomy afternoon.  KQG

In this humorous holiday tale, French’s droll and perpetually ravenous wombat 
discovers Santa’s reindeer eating a plateful of carrots left out for them. Carrots being 
the wombat’s vegetable of choice, the wombat proceeds to go head to head with the 
reindeer in a staring contest of wills (“Fought major battle with strange creatures”); 
after winning the coveted carrots, he promptly snuggles up on the runners of Santa’s 
sleigh to sleep, only to have the sleigh take off. Fortunately, each of Santa’s stops 
offers a bounty of more orange veggies (“Never knew there were so many carrots 
in the world!”), and the wombat thoroughly enjoys his journey despite a few mis-
haps (after mistaking a chimney for a wombat hole, he needs a leg up from Santa 
to get back out). Upon finally returning home, the wombat falls asleep against a 
carrot-filled stocking. Although this is basically a one-joke story, the combination 
of French’s dryly comic narration and Whatley’s waggish illustrations (rendered in 
194 • The bulleTin
acrylic paint on watercolor paper) make it a highly enjoyable one. The wombat is 
adorable in its chocolate-brown rotundity, and Whatley manages to convey a surpris-
ing amount of hilarity through the wombat’s eyes (heavy lids indicate disapproval 
while wide eyes convey the wombat’s surprise or joy) and through the positioning 
of its pudgy body (it is frequently and amusingly prone to lying with all four legs 
sticking straight up). This could make a diverting Christmas Eve readaloud, along 
with a plate of carrots for the reindeer . . . and whoever else Santa brings along.  JH

Dad collapses in the living room, is hustled to the hospital in critical condition, and 
then faces a long and arduous recovery from what turns out to be a stroke. Bennett 
is temporarily swept up into the household of his only nearby relative, Aunt Laura, 
who, along with her fit and healthy family, alternately coaxes and bullies Bennett

he’s looking and feeling a little better, and he even joins the cross-country team at 
school, but his lack of control over his domestic situation and his own choices are

protagonist, but each trial is credible and intrinsic to his situation—the school bully 
who won’t leave the fat kid in peace; the medical insurance limits that threaten 
to bankrupt the Robinsons; the pressure of a blossoming relationship with a girl 
who’s showing interest in him; the challenges of cross-country competition for a 
kid who’s just getting his breath and stride; and of course, the constant worry about 
his father’s recovery. While the ending puts father and son on a happier path, it’s

This new entry in the Scientists in the Field series again demonstrates that you 
can find science in unexpected places. Frydenborg (author of They Dreamed of 
Horses, BCCB 6/94) brings her equestrian knowledge to bear in an examination 
of the biologists who study the wild horses in Maryland’s Assateague State Park. 
The focal scientist is Dr. Jay Kirkpatrick, who, with his partner Dr. John Turner, 
has been studying wild horses for decades in hope of preserving them; the ef-
forts of the scientists culminated with the development and administration of a 
birth-control vaccine that has allowed herds to stay within manageable levels and 
increased the health and longevity of the mares. This is an interesting blend of a 
romantic, appealing subject and a practical approach; absorbing information about 
wild horse behavior combines effectively with fascinating details about the creation 
of the birth-control vaccine and relevant facts about law and policy that affect

what happens to various horse populations. Copious photographs are sometimes 
engaging, sometimes coolly realistic (as in the images of equine corpses amid the

wild horses. General horsey information about evolutionary history, nomenclature 
(“When Is a Pony Really a Horse?”), horse color, etc., appears in sidebar interjec-

After an arduous journey up Peryton Peak, Princess Zora reaches the summit only to 
be disappointed: the mountain is seemingly abandoned, the Peryton clan vanished, 
and with it Zora’s hopes of uniting the five clans of Penthos and proving her value 
to her family. If that weren’t bad enough, she’s soon chased by a walking corpse 
hungry for her flesh, and she has to be rescued by Broxo, a scrappy, uncouth boy 
who attempts to feed her lizards and refuses to discuss the fate of the missing clan. 
Meanwhile, the only other human resident of the mountain, a witch named Ulith, 
is keeping a close eye on the two teenagers, and it’s clear that she and her minions 
(two ferret-like creatures, a wolflike monster, etc.) have plans for Zora and Broxo, 
but whether for good or for ill remains undetermined until the very end. Magic, 
zombies, adventure, and a bit of humor all converge in this well-paced graphic 
novel. Characters are surprisingly well-developed, considering the book’s brevity: 
Zora, Broxo, and Ulith are all haunted by their past in some way or another, and 
flashbacks (signified by a shift in a palette dominated by mossy, muted greens to 
sepia tones) imbue each of the three characters with a significant backstory without 
detracting from the main story arc. The full-color illustrations on glossy pages are 
both striking and economical, with simple expressions and color changes easily 
conveying shifts in character mood, environment, or time. While this is lighter on 
the gross factor than some zombie tales, with the more gruesome violence generally 
taking place offstage, the final act that Broxo must commit to save Zora and himself 
is both graphic and heartbreaking. Out of the horde of zombie books as of late, 
this one has plenty to satisfy a middle-schooler craving action and emotion.  KQG

There’s a new sixth-grade language arts teacher, and Minnie is amazed and thrilled 
by her: the unconventional Miss Marks wears jeans and message tees and encourages 
her class to freewrite and ask important questions. The orderly and well-behaved 
Minnie is startled to realize that she actually does have a lot of questions. Is her 
uncle, returned from Iraq and now living in the basement, really crazy? Why do 
people give Minnie’s classmate and friend Amira a hard time about her headscarf? 
And why is the school board trying to remove Miss Marks, Minnie’s favorite teacher 
ever? There’s definitely a purposive streak to the story, and Miss Marks is fairly 
hackneyed as an idealistic young teacher; on the other hand, starry-eyed young 
professionals often are rather hackneyed, and she’s pretty plausible, both in her 
rebellions and in her star appeal to her class. The heart of this story, however, lies 
with Minnie, young perfectionist whose constant concern about being judged often 
keeps her silent. Her gradual understanding that adulthood doesn’t unlock all the 
answers and her growing confidence in the significance of her own questions are 
thoughtfully explored but never overdrawn; her growth is believable in its spurts 
and reversals. Fans of Claudia Mills’ thoughtful and sometimes anxious protagonists

with her gorgeous assistant George, performs feats of clairvoyance for audiences in 
rented halls, and connects grieving clients with relatives who have “passed over.” 
Readers will plainly see what ambitious but naïve Velvet does not—that Madame 
and George are con artists, scrambling to keep up with the latest tricks of the trade 
among their London spiritualist rivals, and bilking the bereaved out of their property 
and fortunes by passing along directives from beyond to set up philanthropic trusts, 
administered of course by Madame and George. Escalating risks and a clever little 
plot twist add value to a storyline that might otherwise amount to no more than a 
steady march toward Velvet’s inevitable epiphany. Readers who relished the bogus 
rappings, levitations, and ectoplasmic emanations of Schlitz’s A Drowned Maiden’s 
Hair or Jocelyn’s How It Happened in Peach Hill (BCCB 11/06, 5/07) will want a 
seat at Madame Savoya’s table.  EB

After providing a brief recap of the lives of Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan, Hop-
kinson proceeds in this picture-book biography to focus on what is perhaps the most 
engrossing aspect of Keller’s life for a child reader—the process by which Sullivan 
led her isolated student out of silence and darkness into full communication with 
her world. Each section begins with an excerpt from a letter from Sullivan to a 
friend at the Perkins Institution for the Blind: “She has tyrannized over everybody. 
. . . To get her to do the simplest thing . . . it was necessary to use force.” Thus she 
introduces the bitter battles that ensued over ink bottles and table manners. Of 
course, brighter days lay ahead after little Helen began to finger-spell: “Helen is 
learning adjectives and adverbs as easily as she learned nouns.” Hopkinson then 
explains how Sullivan methodically taught Helen the concept of numbers by spell-
ing “puppy,” letting her feel the animals, spelling “puppies,” holding up a finger 
for each puppy counted, and then spelling the total number, “five.” The generous 
excerpts from Sullivan’s correspondence attest to the teacher’s growing pride in her 
student, and by the final entry she describes a girl who had raced from wordlessness 
to emergent reading and writing in just a few months. Attractive book design, with 
text sparingly parceled out onto ample white space and one or more large pictures 
in every spread, is unintimidating, and Colón’s line and watercolor artwork, though 
a bit on the tepid side, clearly conveys the mechanics of various methods of com-
munication. Endpapers feature photographs of Keller and Sullivan, and brief lists 
for further print and online reading are included.  EB

Smaller than the other experimental mice chosen to accompany a group of astro-
nauts on a space shuttle mission, little Meteor is nonetheless confident and excited 
to be going on such a journey. While the other mice “cling to their cage in terror” 
in space, Meteor enjoys the sensation of being weightless and is thrilled when he is 
able to help the astronauts with a small, but difficult, task: retrieving a control panel 
key that has become wedged in a tiny crack behind a monitor onboard. Author 
and astronaut Mark Kelly explains in a note afterwards that this fictional story has 
a tiny kernel of truth: among a group of experimental mice that once accompanied 
Kelly on a space mission, there was one who “seemed to enjoy the experience and 
effortlessly floated around the cage.” Kelly also provides a brief history of space 
flight, of the NASA shuttle program, and of space-traveling animals, as well as a 
bibliography and list of internet resources. The plot is pretty minimal, and there’s 
an uneasy combination of anthropomorphism and utilitarianism in the treatment of 
the space-borne mice. Still, the idea of a tiny mouse astronaut will appeal to many 
kids, especially fans of White’s Stuart Little, and Payne’s mixed media art excels 
at both providing a detailed look at the shuttle’s interior and the astronauts while 
capitalizing on the cute factor of Meteor as fuzzy little space traveler. The slightly

Whenever Tee is traveling with her writer father, it’s her role to take care of him 
and her little brother, Jack. Now they’re in Nome, Alaska, for a few weeks, and 
twelve-year-old Tee is delighted to find a friend there in another girl, Quin. The 
girls are spooked but intrigued when they find a fierce and beautiful—and ghost-
ly—dog in a nearby abandoned miner’s shack. Determined to find out the story 
behind the dog’s presence, they dive into local history, but their fascination ends 
up endangering their lives. There’s not much in the way of shivers here, and the 
plot uses some pretty timeworn devices to get to its point but never really develops 
characters along the way. Additionally, the backstory narrative, about a pair of 
sisters and their beloved dog in 1965, is both melodramatic and implausible. On 
the domestic side, however, this is a solidly written tale about a girl who’s tired of 
having to be the family grownup and who’s exploring possibilities of liberation in 
a new place and a new friend. This has a lot in common with Shahan’s Ice Island 
(BCCB 2/12), including the climactic blizzard that requires the kids to draw on 
their survival skills, so readers who enjoyed that Alaskan outing may wish to strap 
on their snowshoes for this one.  DS

Twelve-year-old Taemon is kind, principled, and clever—and now completely 
lacking in psi, the telekinetic ability around which his entire society is structured. 
The ability to use your psi is predicated on morality—it won’t work if you go 
against your own conscience—and Taemon’s gift disappeared after he almost killed 
his cruel, power-hungry older brother Yens, who had left him to drown. After 
Taemon is exiled to a nearby community for the psi-less (which welcomes him 
warmly), Yens is chosen as the True Son, a figurehead for the corrupt priesthood 
that rules their society. Numerous plot threads converge—impending war with a 
neighboring country, Taemon’s spiritual awakening, the potentially deadly secrets 
of the psi-less community—with rising urgency. Krumwiede explores a multitude 
of themes, including the corrupting influence of power, the distinctions between 
religious faith and religious institutions, and the social construction of disability, 
with a light and creative hand; this is a smart book, but never a preachy one. The 
world in which psi has replaced all other kinds of “primitive” advancement is 
constructed in fascinating detail, as are the prophecies, moral teachings, and per-
ceptions of human traits and destinies built around a zodiac-like calendar system. 
Taemon is a strong, likable character, both childlike and heroic, with the classic 
appeal of the perennial outsider who nevertheless yearns for home. Reminiscent 
of Le Guin’s Gifts (BCCB 10/04) or Lowry’s The Giver (BCCB 4/93) in its moral 
curiosity and understated complexity, this debut novel builds to a startling, satisfy-

In this alternative future New York, global warming has flooded the city’s streets, 
magic-wielding mystics are drained of their powers and forced to live in the grimy 
Depths, and the wealthy elite use appropriated magic to power a world of luxury 
in the Aeries. One of the elite, seventeen-year-old Aria Rose, has been carrying on 
a secret romance with Thomas Foster, the son of her father’s adversary—or so she’s 
told when she wakes from the near-fatal drug overdose that has destroyed her recent 
memory. Unable to ignore doubts about a passion she can’t remember, however, 
Aria sneaks out to the Depths to spark her memory and meets Hunter, a hand-
some mystic rebel, who helps her on a quest to uncover the secrets of her own past 
and to understand her role in the war that is about to erupt between the mystics 
and her family. The novel’s intriguing premise will please fans of romantic fantasy, 
particularly its imaginative recasting of the conventional Romeo and Juliet storyline. 
The first in a series, much of the novel is dedicated to setting up the conflict for 
future volumes, but it still includes plenty of its own action. Unfortunately, the 
otherwise compelling story is undermined by lackluster world-building, including 
several noticeable gaps in logic, and shallow characters. Though Aria’s evolution from 
naïve pawn to courageous revolutionary makes her a heroine worth rooting for, her 
seemingly endless cluelessness becomes annoying, while Hunter never rises above 
the standard romantic hero. Nevertheless, readers looking for an action-centered 
romance with a sci-fi sheen, a sort of Gossip Girls meets Total Recall, may find the 
premise here diverting.  AM

of the moon’s absence from the sky. When an enigmatic and beautiful storyteller

Eddie (the nice twin) and Tom (the smart twin) were separated at birth, but they 
share a telepathic connection. The catch? Tom lives in 2011, and Eddie lives in 
1957—or, more accurately, on a “twinned” version of Earth that started about fifty 
years after the first so that the aliens who created it could see what atrocities were 
coming on Earth 1 and tweak events on Earth 2 to avoid them. Since the atomic 
bomb, though, the aliens have decided that both Earths are unredeemable and their 
monitors are preparing for its destruction. Eddie and Tom are the keys to the only 
person who might be able to thwart that plan—their father, a rogue monitor—and 
their plan to save the world requires them to switch places and blend into their new 
homes. This is approachable, with its short chapters and whimsical tone, and the 
protagonists are likable. However, this series opener is plagued by loopy logic, from 
the paper-thin premise (it’s never clear exactly what purpose the twin-switch serves, 
other than as a set piece for shenanigans) to the facile treatment of bullying. While 
readers are routinely reminded of how smart Tom is, he does a spectacularly bad 
job of flying under the radar, even arguing with a teacher about Pluto’s planetary 
status; Eddie, meanwhile, is expected to explain his sudden politeness and amnesia 
as a side effect of mood-stabilizing pharmaceuticals. Eddie’s mid-century sensibility 
touches enough on some significant issues (Eddie “had never spoken to a Negro 
person”) to puncture the balloon of light sci-fi action but not enough to explore 
the relevant issues. There’s an appealing voice here, but ultimately readers will be 
better off engaging in intergalactic battles elsewhere.  CG

Bedtime is a known scourge of youthful fun, and the little girl in this picture book 
is having none of it. Her wise parents sidestep her protestation of not being sleepy 
(“They nodded their heads and said she didn’t have to go to sleep. But she had to 
put her pajamas on”), but once she’s in bed she starts a new delaying tactic, inquiring 
about sleeping habits in the animal kingdom. After exploring the sleep habits of 
bats, whales, and tigers, she’s inspired enough by their snoozes to fall asleep herself. 
While the story runs a little long, Logue effectively combines domesticity and lyri-
cism, and the back-and-forth rhythm is tenderly soporific. Zagarenski (illustrator 
of the Caldecott Honor–winning Red Sings from Treetops, BCCB 3/09) creates a 
dreamworthy world in her full-page full-bleed illustrations, wherein petite, precise 
pencil lines contrast with rich grainy textures of paint on wood. Hues run to gently

In this final installment of the dystopian quartet that began with The Giver (BCCB 
4/93) nearly twenty years ago, Lowry returns to the original story, this time focusing 
her spare, third-person narration on Claire, the birthmother of a baby whose life was 
threatened by the order-obsessed elders of the dystopian community in the original 
novel. At just fourteen, Claire is a certified Vessel, but when complications arise in 
her pregnancy, an emergency C-section is performed and the “Product” is sent to 
the Nurturing Center while Claire is reassigned elsewhere. She nonetheless finds a 
way to visit her baby, and it is here that readers will begin to see Claire’s connection 
to Jonas and Gabe, two major players the original novel. Where The Giver ends, 
however, Claire’s story continues, following her as she flees the community, loses 
and then regains her memory, and finally makes a bargain with evil, all in an effort 
to find her son. Giving a different perspective to a story that is now a middle-school 
staple is an interesting move, but, more significantly, Lowry revisits the emotional 
core that has made The Giver so popular—the idea of a world without love and the 
consequences therein. The opening parts are thus a haunting, evocative, and beauti-
fully told tale of a mother looking for her son, and though Claire is in an adult in 
her role as the mother, her search for love is universally recognizable. Though the 
final part turns into a less successful morality tale, the connection between Gabe 
and Claire provides an engrossing and accessible anchor to the story, and readers 
will be glad to see both characters find their share of peace.  KQG

“A jet plane stands at the gate. Baggage rides up the belt. Isn’t that your suitcase? 
This must be your plane.” With this introduction, readers imagine themselves in the 
lucky shoes of a young boy who has a window seat right behind the wing, a great 
vantage point for watching some critical bits of the plane in operation. Macaulay 
explains each stage of the flight, from fueling to taxi to takeoff, while diagrams and 
cutaways show how the plane moves away from the gate, how air makes its way 
into the engine’s combustion chamber and out past the spinning turbine, how air 
rushing over the wing surface creates lift, and how pressure on the tail’s elevators 
pushes the plane’s nose up. Although engineering is the main event here, Macaulay 
also adds a few observations about the passenger experience: the clunk of retract-
ing and extending landing gear, the bump of tires hitting tarmac, the ding that 
signals the end of the flight when “everyone jumps up. Bins fly open. Passengers 
move slowly toward the door.” Watercolor views of the machinery and airports 
are just as informative and engaging as one expects from Macaulay. Kids packing 
their carry-ons for flights of their own will want to tuck in a copy. An illustrated 
glossary and index are included.  EB

A pleasant day sailing off the New England coast with her parents turns deadly and 
leaves Lucy Simmons an orphan under the care of her greedy uncle Victor in 1906. 
Fortunately, she is able to remain in the old family home, her father’s “ship on shore,” 
and the enormous mansion seems to be helping Lucy on her quest to ascertain the 
whereabouts of her aunt, her rightful guardian, and evade the punishments of her 
uncle; a sparkly cloud of mist surrounds the house sometimes, often hiding Lucy 
from her uncle’s notice and pointing her toward hidden letters that refer to a fam-
ily curse. Lucy also finds help in Marni, a kindly local woman who introduces her 
to the Perkins children, whose father incidentally caused the accident that killed 
Lucy’s parents. These disjointed storylines come together in a rather spectacular 
conclusion that has the house transforming into a ship and Lucy finally setting off 
on her titular voyage to find her aunt, but the confusing and often tedious build 
up to the final scene is simply not engaging enough to pull readers along. Despite 
their minimal connection to the main plot, the Perkins children are particularly 
compelling as runaways from an abusive father, and while Marni claims to be a 
savior of those in need, her likeness to a portrait of a siren in Lucy’s house indicates 
that her role may become more nefarious in subsequent installments. Indeed, since 
the title’s promised voyage only begins with this book’s conclusion, the groundwork 
for a sequel is well laid, and readers who were intrigued by the unresolved issue of 
Lucy’s family curse may want to accompany Lucy on her seafaring journey.  KQG

At sixteen, Velveteen was kidnapped, tortured, and eventually murdered by a serial 
killer named Bonesaw. Since then, she’s become the top-ranked Salvager in the 
City of the Dead and the leader of a crack team sent into the mortal realm to help 
convey passing souls into the next world. Her postmortem success is all a façade, 
however, and she spends much of her free time trekking back into the “daylight” 
and haunting Bonesaw—an act that is strictly forbidden by the souls that rule the 
City of the Dead. Besides her clandestine hauntings, Velveteen is also trying to 
juggle her attraction to Nick, the newest and most charmingly annoying member of 
her team, and figure out what to do about the Departurists, a revolutionary group 
that threatens to upend the City’s tightly controlled order—not to mention the 
mysterious shadowquakes that are literally ripping purgatory apart. There’s a lot 
going on here, and while each story is individually compelling, the threads never 
quite coalesce into a seamless narrative; readers will be left feeling a bit overwhelmed 
rather than satisfied. The world-building is messy at best, and the rules shift in 
accordance to the needs of the plot. Perhaps most successful is the development 
of Velveteen: violent, vengeful, and ready for battle, Velveteen is anything but the 
sad, mopey ghosts girls YA lit has offered of late, and she’d make quick friends with 
the bloodthirsty vigilante sisters in Dia Reeves’ Slice of Cherry (BCCB 1/11). Her 
final confrontation with Bonesaw is therefore disappointing in its brevity, but the 
arrival of a new enemy for Velveteen and the open ending that hints at a sequel 
may persuade readers to want to linger in the City of the Dead.  KQG

Patrik Chrobak and his friends Danika, Emil, and Karel, thirteen-year-olds in 1960s 
Czechoslovakia, are united by their liberal-minded parents and their penchant for 
pulling anti-government pranks. The boys’ minor acts of vandalism wouldn’t amount 
to much in another time or place, but in the repressive climate, the pranks land 
Patrik squarely on the radar of the school principal. As he takes his punishments 
and plans his next stunts, his father, a psychiatrist, is under pressure at work to turn 
in false diagnoses that would lead to the demotion, or even asylum commitment, 
of political troublemakers. The situation escalates when Danika falls for a new 
student whose family has strong Communist party ties, igniting Patrik’s jealousy. 
Patrik, in turn, takes greater risks to prove his bravery and regain Danika’s atten-
tion; when he sets fire to a pro-government flag during a parade, he is told he must 
leave school and apprentice as a miner at the end of the term. The Chrobaks are 
now desperate enough to attempt escape through Yugoslavia and across the sea to 
Italy, even though they realize they will lose all their belongings and professional 
status, and they know they are being watched by pro-government neighbors and 
“friends.” Marsden’s prose is a bit choppy and it’s sometimes inconsistent in its 
reading level, but her depiction of Patrik, whose hot-headed, heedless actions put 
his family in the line of danger, will strike a familiar note with young adolescents.

Born a dwarf in the late sixteenth-century Spanish Netherlands, fifteen-year-old Jepp 
believes that the stars have destined him for a quiet, isolated existence. Sheltered 
from mistreatment by a caring woman he thinks is his mother, he is lured away to 
the court of the Infanta (the ruler of the territory) with the promise of an education, 
a chance to be with others like himself, and a place of honor in the world. Instead 
he finds himself living a puzzling new kind of life that is equal parts coddling and 
abuse, as both favorite pet and humiliated court stooge. When his attempt to rescue 
a horribly abused friend ends in her tragic death, Jepp is secreted away from the 
court and into the household of the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe. At first he 
continues to endure miserable treatment, but he eventually earns a place of respect 
through his own cleverness. Struggling to become a self-made man and earn the 
love of a girl in a world that believes your birth defines your fate, Jepp eventually 
returns to the Infanta’s court to uncover the secret of his parentage in hopes of 
defying the stars. Drawn from stories of real dwarves who worked as entertainers 
in the households of Spanish royalty and Danish nobility, this outstanding work 
of historical fiction provides readers with more than just an imagined biography. 
Incorporating elements of adventure, romance, tragedy, intrigue, and science, the 
novel conjures a place and time not commonly explored in young adult fiction and 
offers plenty of period detail. Jepp is an engaging hero, who both longs to explore 
the larger world and yet feels trapped by a fate he understands to be written in the 
stars. Other characters, both historically based and invented, are memorable and 
skillfully drawn. This novel is a perfect fit for fans of historical adventure (such as 
Heuston’s Dante’s Daughter, BCCB 3/04) looking for a new world to explore and 
a new kind of hero to take them there.  AM

Teenagers Boone and Robbie are dumpster diving for treasure when Robbie sees a 
murder take place in a nearby building. The boys beat it out of the alley like light-
ning, but not before the murderers catch a good look at the witness. Within days, 
Robbie is gunned down in a drive-by shooting; their friend Andre, in whom Robbie 
might have confided, is next to go—on the steps of the church at Robbie’s funeral. 
Boone knows he’s got to be on the hit list as well, but he’s too scared to go to the 
police. Instead, he starts snooping around on his own and uncovers some rotten 
goings-on at his own high school, involving a violent-tempered past acquaintance, 
a pretty girlfriend, a suspicious suicide, another murder, and a video camera wired 
into the girls’ locker room. Deas’ black and white illustrations, with occasional 
Gorey-esque crimson blood splatters, are appropriately edgy and atmospheric, and 
ample swaths of pitch-black negative space add to the moodiness. The mystery 
itself, however, is less engrossing than the neighborhood noir setting, and most of 
the story’s fascination will revolve around wondering just how high McClintock’s 
body count will go. Nonetheless, the arty creepiness of the overall look should be 
enough to entice bystanders to ask, “Whatcha readin’?”  EB

In this faux guidebook to the island of Neverbelieve, Messenger provides readers 
with detailed illustrations of the land’s flora, fauna, and geographical features along 
with the story of his spellbinding discovery of the island and its subsequent disap-
pearance (the island can sprout legs and move) after he left to check on his boat. 
A topographical overview of the island is presented first, in which the reader can 
note the locations of the animals and vegetation featured on the following pages. 
The landscape and its inhabitants have surprising, topsy-turvy characteristics, 
such as the Cabbage Moth Tree that produces cabbage moths, rather than leaves, 
on the ends of its branches, the Octofrog that is part octopus and part frog, and 
Book Mountain, an enormous pile of “book-shaped rock formations” that read 
themselves aloud at night. There’s not much plot here, but the project is a deeply 
appealing one, and the details are weird and amusing. Creative kids with an eye for 
the quirky will eagerly spend a long time poring over the meticulous illustrations, 
expertly rendered in watercolor and colored pencil, and jauntily formal captions. 
Foldout flaps offer even more detail and opportunity for closer inspection of some 
of the island’s organic and geologic offerings. Both art and text effectively echo the 
scholarly tone of old botanical texts, and the book as a whole seems tailor-made to 
inspire kids to design their own strange and astonishing lands.  JH

High school presents certain obstacles for Colin Fisher, whose Asperger’s means he 
has difficulty reading social cues despite his high intelligence. When a melee breaks 
out in the cafeteria one day, culminating in a gun’s going off, Colin is convinced that 
as the nearest person to the gun he’s likely to be suspected of being the shooter. He 
therefore decides to bring his inquisitive nature and love of logic to the problem and 
solve the mystery himself, a plan that leads to a strange partnership between Colin 
and one of his biggest tormentors, the bullying Wayne. While the neuro-atypical 
detective is now familiar casting, Colin’s an interesting character, with his logical 
and literal approach often serving as a shield rather than a drawback (it even allows 
him become an ace shooter in basketball). Inclusions of passages from his precious 
notebook, where he jots down his observations and questions about the world, add 
texture to the story. The narrative wavers between focalizing through Colin and 
treating him as a marvelous show, however, and the book sometimes is more adult 
in its references and language than the accessible format would suggest. Secondary 
characters are flatly drawn and difficult to keep straight, and the mystery itself is 
more complicated than interesting. Colin and his thought process are the appeal 
here, so this could interest readers looking for observations about school dynamics 
as well as readers who enjoyed Dowd’s The London Eye Mystery (BCCB 4/08).  DS

When sixteen-year-old Billie Paradise gets the news that her grandmother has 
died and bequeathed Billie the family home, she knows it means trouble: her 
disturbed and erratic mother left the small Cornish town when she was a teenager 
pregnant with Billie, and has largely refused to speak about her parents—and Bil-
lie’s father—since then. When Billie, her mother, and little brother abruptly leave 
London for Cornwall, Billie wonders if she might find out more about the family 
she never knew, and once in Cornwall, she starts hunting for information. She 
also finds handsome and caring Danny, with whom she immediately connects, in 
an emotional lift she desperately needs as her mother spirals further down and as 
family secrets begin to surface. This is actually the story of three generations, as 
Nadin interweaves Billie’s narration with third-person, italicized accounts of key 
moments in the lives of Billie’s mother and Billie’s grandmother to tell the hidden 
stories that Billie is just discovering. The writing effectively balances Billie’s often 
quick and fragmented thoughts with longer, more detailed observations, resulting 
in smooth, rhythmic storytelling. There’s a bit of an overload on secrets, but the 
book brings taut writing together with considerable sympathy for its characters: 
Billie’s grandmother, trapped in a loveless and controlling marriage, is particularly 
poignant, and Billie’s anxious negotiation of being the new girl in a tightly knit 
small town is capably depicted. Ultimately, the soap-opera story rises above the 
melodrama, and readers with family histories of dull stability will wish for a little 
bit of Billie’s intrigue in their own lives.  DS

The childhood of a Native American woman on the Plains in the mid-nineteenth 
century is described here by Lakota tribe member and noted biographer Nelson. 
Drawing from the work of Gilbert L. Wilson, an anthropologist who met with 
Buffalo Bird Girl and transcribed her life story, Nelson focuses specifically on the 
Hidatsa woman’s childhood in Like-a-Fishhook Village near the Missouri River in 
what is now North Dakota. Each section begins with a quote from Buffalo Bird 
Girl and proceeds to describe the various ins and outs of living on the Plains: the 
architecture and layout of Buffalo Bird Girl’s earth-mound home; the tasks of gar-
dening, hunting, and childcare that were divided among the tribe; conflicts with 
both neighboring tribes and white traders; and the eventual forced removal of her 
people to a reservation. Nelson’s quiet, respectful tone capably balances the factual 
details of daily life in the Hidatsa tribe with the obvious joy and nostalgia Buffalo 
Bird Girl feels toward her childhood (“I look back upon my girlhood as the hap-
piest time of my life”). The stellar layout reflects this balance, with simple black 
and white photos with informative captions interspersed among Nelson’s elegant 
art, some which consists of simple, pencil sketches while other pages are full-page, 
acrylic paintings resplendent in earth tones and hues of burnished golds, sky blues, 
and rusty reds. Back matter includes an extensive author’s note, a detailed timeline, 
source notes, and a source bibliography.  KQG

Summer is stretching on a bit long for the kids in Meadeville, South Carolina. Stella 
has played one too many card games with lazy Gerald on his rooftop, while her older 
brother Levi and his friends have run through the gamut of their mischief-making 
schemes. It’s Mr. Mineo’s wayward homing pigeon, Sherman, who provides Mead-
eville with some temporary entertainment: the bird swoops around town, alighting 
on Gerald’s roof, in a neighbor’s barn, in Levi’s sight but out of his reach, and on 
the head of Mutt, the town liar, who can’t convince the other kids he knows where 
the pigeon is likely to be. O’Connor predictably brings these residents together 
in a climactic quest for Sherman, who’s been waiting all along to be reunited with 
his avian lady love, Amy. Bird sightings and capture plans don’t really amount to 
much of a plot, though, and fans who have been entertained tramping alongside 
O’Connor’s small-town kids on their small but significant adventures (How to Steal 
a Dog, BCCB 6/07; The Fantastic Secret of Owen Jester, BCCB 10/10) may find 
pigeon sighting—even one-legged pigeon sighting—a little too uneventful. Still, 
O’Connor’s rhythmic prose is a great match for readers in need of some gentle 
support, who will find that completing an entire novel is adventure enough. EB

ice. She starts with the excitement of the first ice, a sheer crust across the top of a 
water pail in the barn, and moves on to thicker and thicker manifestations of ice 
as fields, then streams and ponds, freeze over. The highlight of the “ice season” for 
Obed was the huge and carefully tended ice rink (named “Bryan Gardens” after 
the family’s garden where the rink was constructed each year) in her own backyard 
and the bustle of activity (hockey games, figure skating, and an elaborate neighbor-
hood “ice show”) it prompted. This is a love song not only to the joys of skating, 
nature, and winter but also to Obed’s father, who features prominently as he takes 
the children skating up a frozen stream, cheerfully oversees the maintenance of the 
backyard ice rink, and clowns around on his skates for the family’s amusement. 
Obed’s writing is as clear and carefully formed as the ice she loves; her detailed 
descriptions will have kids in northern areas clamoring for a rink of their own while 
those who have never experienced outdoor ice will likely find this delightfully exotic. 
The book itself is prettily petite, with a tasteful, quiet design that’s nicely but not 
obtrusively old-fashioned; McClintock’s frequent black and white line drawings 
are both sturdy and elegant, with lots of hatching to provide depth and texture to 
the icy scenes. This trim title would make a mellifluous winter bedtime book, or a 
piquant precursor to a skating outing or a seasonal nature study.  JH

The war is finally over, and the boys at Aaron’s Brooklyn yeshiva are more interested 
in basketball and comic books than world affairs. Into their tight-knit circle comes 
Daniel, an orphaned Holocaust survivor, who, along with twenty other Polish refu-
gees, will be sharing already crowded dorm space with the American boys. Daniel is 
quiet, obviously bright, and strangely attached to a metal box that he carries by day 
and keeps under his pillow at night. Aaron, who stutters, empathizes with the odd 
outsider, but the other boys are rougher and swipe the box to examine its contents. 
What they first mistake as a greasy rock is actually a brick of soap, which Daniel 
believes may have been rendered from the remains of his parents who perished 
in a concentration camp. This slim, compelling volume, based on the experience 
of  Rabbi Rafael Grossman, feels more like a parable than a memoir, and readers 
won’t want to miss the end matter’s the touching, humane coda to “Daniel’s” tale, 
which testifies to his eventual emotional recovery. Full-page watercolors with an air

care of the father she hardly knows, joining him on a mission to take seventeen-

itself is a serio-comic pastiche of calamities, with Ricki mightily attracted to the

nothing remotely funny, though, when Ian turns on Ricki, causing her the pain of 
yet another betrayal and testing whether Dad is really as committed to his daughter

Sixteen-year-old Ellie Overholt expected that her summer vacation to a seaside 
village in Norway would allow her a peaceful visit with her grandmother, but in-
stead there’s trouble: the townspeople believe that Ellie and her grandmother play 
a role in the mysterious disappearances of several local boys. Even more troubling 
is the fact that they’re not really wrong: the culprits, Ellie discovers, are Valkyries, 
gorgeous young women with seductive magic, and Ellie is one of them. Before she 
can fully understand what it means to be Valkyrie, though, her brother Graham 
arrives, with his flirtatious, crush-worthy best friend Tuck in tow, and then disap-
pears like the other boys. Now Ellie must use her fledgling powers to save herself 
and Tuck from angry villagers and to rescue her brother and the other boys from 
her Valkyrie sisters. Set in real-world Norway and populated by fantastic characters 
from Norse mythology, this smartly crafted story of a girl coming to grips with 
newfound power mixes just the right amount of heart-racing action and heart-
stopping romance. The central conflict avoids the simplicity of a conventional 
battle between good and evil, and Ellie is forced to play a complicated game of 
ever-changing allies and enemies. Ellie herself is an authentic teenage girl, who is 
both terrified by the world of magic and violence into which she has been thrown 
and excited by the discovery of her own innate, dangerous power. Readers who 
like a strong, talented heroine who can save the day but still lose her heart to a 
roguish equal, in the spirit of Cashore’s Graceling (BCCB 1/09) and Melling’s The

Nazi occupation of Norway forces a reconfiguration of friendships among fourteen-

in propaganda that explains a clash between Aryans and Jews as the coming of 
Ragnarok; Aksel, the eldest of the set, uses affiliation with the Nazis as a vehicle 
for personal vendettas; Espen and, later, some of his teammates, carry out acts of 
resistance. Espen begins as a courier, and by the time the war draws toward an end, 
he has amassed enough knowledge of the covert networks and communications 
system to be a threat both to the Nazis and to fellow Resistance workers, should

carefully chosen and integrated quotations from Keller herself. This is an effective 
introduction to the blind and deaf woman whose life story has perennially held 
strong appeal for children, most of whom will be particularly interested in her 
breakthrough tutelage by Annie Sullivan: “Annie gave Helen a doll and with her 
fingers traced the letters D-O-L-L on Helen’s palm. Helen thought Annie wanted 
the doll back, so she kicked and screamed.” After describing the misunderstandings 
and tantrums between teacher and student, Rappaport quotes Keller’s summative 
comment, “In the still, dark world in which I lived, there was no tenderness.” Fig-
ures appear stiff and waxen in many of Tavares’ mixed-media scenes, and poses are 
frequently sentimentalized. The oversized format, however, allows him to feature 
hand movements, Braille reading, and grooved writing board techniques, which 
will assist readers in understanding the many ways Keller communicated with and

Despite the appeal of Ash and Natalie’s forbidden romance and their many steamy 
scenes together, their relationship is probably the weakest link in this dystopian 
tale of doomed love. Their characters lack any real development, so they fail to 
evoke reader attachment, making the romance feel disingenuous and (pardon the

in 1965, suffers atrocities during the white government’s removal of her black

community to the “Native Reserves.” After being brutally raped by a white over-
seer, Tariro joins the revolutionary rebels in their fight against the white colonial 
oppressors. Decades later, Tariro finally regains her family’s land in 2001 due to 
black president Mugabe’s support of “resettlement,” in which black Zimbabweans 
took back (sometimes forcefully) ownership of lands from white settlers. The land 
that the now adult Tariro reclaims is currently the home of fourteen-year-old white 
Zimbabwean Katie Watson, and Katie, raised to despise blacks, must come to terms 
with a tremendous fall in privilege after having grown up with all the advantages 
of a white farmer’s daughter in Zimbabwe. Katie’s father is also Tariro’s rapist, and 
she gradually tries to reconcile the strong, loving father that she knows with the 
lies he has taught her about her right to her elite status. Although it is sometimes 
challenging to keep straight Robert’s large cast of characters, Tariro’s and Katie’s 
story threads are compelling and the overlapping plot is gripping. Particularly 
chilling are small moments in which both Katie and Tariro see through the façade 
of white male privilege, Tariro as she faces Watson and his cronies, and Katie as 
she observes the casual violence of her young adult male cousins. While there’s a 
touch of didactism here, especially in the closing chapter in which young Katie and 
adult Tariro meet, this is a strong and overall remarkably nuanced look at a piece 
of history unfamiliar to most American teens.  JH

Four related books by British Children’s Laureate Rosen, previously published 
only in Britain, are here compiled into a single anthology. Each section has six or 
seven entries, several of them recurring: “Nat and Anna,” stories about a little boy 
and his older sister; “What If . . .,” musing free-verse poems about nonsensical 
possibilities; and “Things We Say,” a full-spread scene or series of vignettes with 
speech balloons providing the only text. While some entries are stronger than others, 
there’s an easygoing childlike silliness throughout (the “What If . . .” meanderings 
will particularly ring true), and Rosen’s poetry evinces a gently rollicking rhythm 
that gives a nursery-rhyme lilt to the verses (“Down at the doctor’s/ where every-
body goes,/ there’s a fat black dog/ with messy missy toes . . .”). Blake’s well-loved 
line and watercolor scrawls effectively complement his familiar speedy, amusing 
thumbnails with occasional larger and more immersive full-page visions. This offers 
the charm of selection to youngsters, who will enjoy instructing their adults which 
entry to read aloud and choosing whether to follow a particular strand throughout 
or to happen upon it in sequence. A detailed table of contents helps searchers find 
where they’re going.  DS

As his bar mitzvah approaches, Isaac is nowhere near ready for his entry into man-
hood, so his older brother, Josh, decides to take matters into his own hands. The 
trouble is, Isaac is nothing like tough Josh, who is convinced that the last thing the 
world needs is one more smart but physically weak Jew, and who has the muscle to 
make his little brother do whatever he says. With their parents away in Italy, Josh 
devises a series of manly activities for Isaac that include things like learning to shoot 
216 • The bulleTin
a gun, ride a motorcycle, jump off a cliff into a raging river, stand up to a band of 
bullies, and steal a statue out from under a pack of angry Rottweilers. Meanwhile, 
Isaac is determined to figure out the puzzle that his brother has become. Isaac’s 
narration is hilarious, moving between sardonic commentary and exasperated fury. 
He and his brother are perfect foils for each other, with Isaac using his wits for 
weapons as readily as Josh uses his fists. There’s plenty of adolescent fantasy here 
that dissolves into disaster for our hapless hero, from getting stuck in the dressing 
room of a strip club, to spending a platonic night with an older woman but waking 
up with an embarrassing erection. The ending is unexpectedly poignant, going a 
step beyond the predictable resolution of Isaac and Josh learning to respect each 
other’s differences and appreciate each other’s point of view. Readers on the brink 
of manhood, or at least seeking an end to geeky adolescence, will find a laugh here, 
and quite a bit more besides.  KC

After spending much of her teens bouncing from one foster home to the next, 
sixteen-year-old Darcy Jones feels like she is finally putting down some roots in her 
new foster mom’s Chicago suburb home. Her second year at the same high school 
(a record for Darcy) starts off swimmingly as she rejoins her cadre of artsy friends, 
but when bad boy Conn McCrea shows up, she knows she is in trouble. Not only 
is Conn hot and mysterious, he seems to know something about her past, a trait 
that makes him all the more alluring since Darcy can’t remember anything before 
she was abandoned at a firehouse at age five. A few kisses, a pair of handcuffs, and a 
trip to an alternate Chicago later, and Darcy discovers that she is actually a Shade—a 
ghostlike, supernatural creature—and her species have been at war with humans 
in an alternate universe, a realm in which Conn is a Shade-hunting ace. Rutkoski 
draws an intriguing world, and the alternative version of Chicago is particularly 
appealing, with touches of steampunk and dystopia thrown in for good measure. 
The relationship between Conn and Darcy is well developed, following an organic 
arc, and Darcy herself is a three-dimensional heroine whose ultimate goal is to not 
just catch a guy but figure out who she is. Artistic and literary allusions abound 
in both Chicagos, and creative types will especially relate to Darcy’s unique way 
of looking at the world. Fans of supernatural romances will be pleased to find one 
that is both appropriately steamy and well written.  KQG

Anahita is thrilled to be on her way to her betrothed’s city of Marv in Persia in the 
early 1900s. When she is kidnapped along the way, she doesn’t panic, because she’s 
confident that between her own tribe and her fiancé’s, she will soon be rescued. 
Meanwhile, she watches for ways she can help her friends track her. There are set-

ends up in the harem of a despotic emir. Caught between negotiations and neces-
sity, Anahita must plot to save herself, while her father, fiancé, grandmother, and

friends face troubles of their own in the emir’s fortress. While the prose is sometimes 
stiff, it’s also often touched with metaphorical grace; the events are clear, and the 
periodic shifts in narrative perspective, from Anahita’s first-person account to the 
third-person narration of events taking place on her behalf, keep readers engaged 
in this action-laden adventure in a seldom-explored historical setting. A list of 
characters and places prefaces the novel, and a glossary and discussion guide follow; 
in a wide-ranging author’s note that treats the history, language, art, and poetry of 
the region, Sayres describes the bride kidnapping going on during the time of the 
story and then provides an update on current practices of enslavement and traf-
ficking. Although this extensive apparatus suggests that the book is clearly meant 
for curricular use, readers will also find plenty of enjoyment in the classic story of 
a strong-willed heroine fighting for her own freedom and happiness in a land of 
serene dervishes, untrustworthy khans, ruthless emirs, and interesting customs.  KC

Perry’s college application essay, which details a prom night filled with murder and 
mayhem when Gobi, his frumpy, exchange-student date, transforms into a sexy 
European assassin (in Au Revoir, Crazy European Chick, BCCB 12/11), turns into 
an internet sensation, but he decides to take a gap year anyway to see if his band, 
Inchworm, has what it takes to become famous. It seems to. Perry’s new girlfriend 
Paula, who is older and far more glamorous than Perry and yet still seems to find 
him irresistible, works for a very important industry person who has booked Inch-
worm on a European tour. Perry can’t resist meeting up with Gobi again in Venice, 
and it’s once again game on, with Perry barely managing to keep up with the body 
count Gobi is racking up all over Europe. Okay, that’s an exaggeration, but that’s 
what this homage to The Bourne Identity feels like, with its string of breathtaking 
near-misses, harrowing stand-offs, and constant threats of mortal danger. This time, 
though, it’s Perry’s fault through and through: his story has outed Gobi for the 
fearlessly effective weapon that she is, causing rival kingpins to vie violently for her 
services with offers that could be fatal for her to refuse, and then, of course, he leads 
them right to her. The quips fly as fast as bullets here, ricocheting from the freshly 
funny (“Irony was her new ketchup, and she was putting it on everything”) to the 
schmaltziest of hard-boiled kitsch (“The red dot on Gobi’s head held perfectly still 
between her eyes, the punctuation mark that waits for all of us somewhere in the 
end”). Either way, this quick little gem draws a bead dead center between rom-com, 
action/adventure, and caper story and hits its mark with style.  KC

If young readers missed the opportunity to meet world-renowned mime Marcel 
Marceau in Gloria Spielman’s picture-book biography (Marcel Marceau, BCCB 
10/11), here is a second chance. The white face of Marceau’s signature character 
Bip peeks coyly from the folds of a red velvet stage curtain: “Look at this man. He 
climbs imaginary stairs. He bows to an invisible person. . . . He does not speak.” 
A page turn reveals Bip, whiteface nearly indistinguishable from the pure white 
218 • The bulleTin
background, holding a shushing finger against his crimson lips: “He uses his whole 
body onstage . . . but never his voice. His body talks for him.” Having established 
the essence of mime, Schubert segues into a child-accessible account of the years 
before Marceau’s stage career, when he was Marcel Mangel, a French Jew active in the 
Resistance during World War II. Although DuBois conveys the strictly biographi-
cal aspects of Marceau’s story, particularly his experiences throughout the war, in 
soberly hued scenes replete with period detail, he pares away all background when 
he focuses on Marceau’s craft, allowing viewers to appreciate the mime’s superbly 
controlled poses without distraction. Oversized font and rhythmic, present tense 
descriptions of Bip’s performances invite newly independent readers to enter the 
text confidently: “Sometimes he is one person on stage—and sometimes many. 
Sometimes there is music, sometimes not. He never loses the crowd’s attention.” 
An afterword provides additional information about Marceau’s wartime activity, 
Bip’s creation, and even a few tips for children who want to try their hand (actu-
ally, their whole body) at mime; source and quotation notes are also included.  EB

Having dispensed with vampires (Cirque du Freak, BCCB 6/01, etc.) and demons 
(Lord Loss, BCCB 1/06, etc.), Shan turns to zombies for his latest fast-paced 
horror-adventure novel. B only half-believes the reports of zombie outbreaks in 
Ireland until her own London school is overrun and she must fight for survival. 
Shan has an effortless command of nightmarish imagery, and fans will find just 
what they expect in this aggressively gory tale, from a woman who “dug through 
the shredded remains of her husband’s face to scoop out his brains” in the first 
chapter, to B’s ongoing dreams of being trapped on a plane with creepy talking 
cannibal babies, to the blood-soaked set piece of the zombie high-school invasion 
at the end. Unfortunately, attempts at deeper thematic explorations of gender 
(B’s gender is deliberately obscured throughout most of the book) and racism (B 
struggles to think for herself outside her dad’s white-supremacist influence) are 
oversimplified and, at least as far as the story progresses in this book, barely related 
to the central horror plot. Additionally, between her racist thought processes and 
her refusal to take responsibility for her heinous acts, B is a fairly unsympathetic 
heroine. Short chapters, copious action, and excruciatingly vivid descriptions of 
people getting eaten alive nonetheless ensure that this is a perfect fit for its target 
audience—reluctant and hi-lo readers with a taste for gore—if few others. Black 
and white illustrations are mostly stiff depictions of panicked humans; ironically, 
the occasional zombies are much more lively.  CG

he finds himself in a new version of either Glenbrook or Marbury, but something 
is always askew. Hovering between each passage is the memory of his sexual abuse 
at the hands of a sadistic predator and his connection with his ancestor Seth, who 
was hanged as a boy and who appears to him as a ghost with healing powers and 
unfinished business. These memories and apparitions call into question the status 
of Marbury itself: is it a real place where the four boys must learn to survive in post-
apocalyptic conditions, or a defensive creation of Jack’s own mind as he struggles 
to come to terms with his rape? Either way, the world itself is studded with the 
most horrific creatures imaginable, from the slimy black leeches that turn humans 
into cannibalistic Hunters with horns projecting from their bodies and loincloths 
made of desiccated body parts, to the Rangers, who are supposedly the good guys 
but who also sport body-part accessories and conscript young boys to swell their 
ranks. The grim fascination with Marbury that won’t let the boys go grips readers 
as well as they, like Jack, become passengers into the darkest corners of a wounded 
human psyche writ large across layers of a dead landscape. Also like Jack, readers 
will hope against hope that there is no new adventure to break the illusory and 
tenuous peace Jack eventually finds. Given Jack’s luck, however, Marbury probably 
isn’t finished with him.  KC

Before becoming the chronicler of the Baudelaire children’s encounters with bad 
luck, Lemony Snicket, in this fictional autobiography, was a mere slip of a boy 
with “an unusual education” that eventually gained him an apprenticeship with an 
elite organization—though what that organization does is apparently not for the 
reader to know. Snicket begins his career of spying? crimefighting? secret-spilling? 
under the laughably inept guidance of S. Theodora Markson, whose services have 
been called upon to return a priceless statuette to its rightful owner in the town 
of Stain’d-by-the-Sea. Of course, there are far more sinister happenings going on 
in the small forgotten village, and a few narrow escapes, conveniently overheard 
conversations, and a named but as-of-yet-unseen villain ensure readers that this is 
a series opener. For those familiar with Snicket’s Series of Unfortunate Events (The 
Bad Beginning, BCCB 9/99, etc.), much here will be familiar: wacky names, a snarky 
tone, hapless grownups who are mostly indulged by the young heroes, and repetitive 
references to offscreen occurrences all appear here. Handler’s—er, Snicket’s writing 
has tightened up a bit, and the hero offers up some poignant moments of wisdom in 
the middle of all the madcap mayhem. Readers who balked at the thirteen-volume 
length of the Unfortunate Event series will be pleased to know there are only four 
books proposed for this series. Occasional cartoony illustrations, in shadowy tones 
of blue, gray, and black, reflect the kooky noir tone of the text.  KQG

wonder why. When she’s finally selected, it turns out to be for an unusual harvest-
ing indeed, and she escapes into the wilderness to avoid becoming a human battery

survive the terrors of the world outside the city walls, and she finds a settlement 
of folks like her—people with particularly strong magic that renews itself rather 
than dissipating as they grow older. The settings are fantastic in both meanings 
of the word, and they’re beautifully drawn; Lark’s experiences add further rich 
detail. Unfortunately, there’s never really a full explanation of why Lark’s power is 
different not only from others in her city but from other Renewables, and readers 
never learn why or how magical resources got scarce in the first place. That may 
be material reserved for a sequel, but the threads in this book aren’t woven tightly 
enough to generate sustained interest in the meantime. Shades of Lowry’s The 
Giver (BCCB 4/93), Bick’s Ashes (BCCB 10/11), Pullman’s His Dark Materials 
(BCCB 4/96, 11/97, 1/01), The Matrix trilogy, and even elements of steampunk 
wisp throughout the narrative at different points, but coherence depends overmuch 
on the temporal narration of Lark’s journey, which becomes attenuated and a little 
dull as she faces one unrelated danger after another. Readers who enjoy speculating 
about gaps that may or may not be filled may nonetheless enjoy this techno-fantasy 
dystopian mashup.  KC

While spending the summer at her late grandmother’s dilapidated house, eleven-
year-old Sarah becomes convinced that the strange knocking noises and cold spots 
mean the old place is haunted. When she discovers a tunnel behind a bookcase 
that leads to the shadowy world of Scotopia, she learns that the house is actually a 
place that helps guide departed souls into one of the next realms. Scotopia is the 
darkest of those worlds, reserved for not-so-nice people; its king, the talking cat 
Balthazat, tricks Sarah to gain admittance to her world and continue his plan of 
stealing light from the cloud people of Ormaz, the sunlit realm meant for pure 
souls. Realizing her mistake, Sarah embarks on a journey to stop Balthazat that 
has her fighting one-eyed demonic sentinels, rescuing her baby brother from near 
death, and finally restoring balance to all of the worlds. There are some clear Biblical 
allusions in this traditional quest story, and the story of Balthazat’s fall from grace 
and Sarah’s interaction with the Cloud Court may particularly strike a chord with 
young Christian readers. No denomination is needed, however, to be thoroughly 
creeped out by the eerie figures that populate the underworld, and Murphy’s black 
and white spot illustrations have a touch of Edward Gorey that highlights the more 
macabre elements of the text. The weakness here is Sarah herself, who magically 
transforms from a self-described scaredy-cat to a girl who nonchalantly gallops 
through a land of giant walking hands and headless guards with nary a care. The 
abrupt ending that concludes with Sarah literally undoing her mistake with a very

When Giulia’s father, a Milanese nobleman, passes away, she is left orphaned and 
friendless in the household of his wife, who thwarts the Count’s last wishes for 
Giulia to be married and sends the girl off to a convent. Before being packed off 
to Santa Marta, Giulia purchases a talisman from a sorcerer to help her achieve 
her heart’s desire, which has always been marriage and the security of her own 
household. Trusting in this magic, Giulia accepts an apprenticeship in the convent’s 
workshop, renowned for its religious paintings, while watching carefully for any 
opportunity to meet the man of her dreams. Such an encounter seems unlikely in 
a convent, but she does indeed catch the eye of the handsome artisan Ormanno, 
who is hired to repair a deteriorating fresco. Soon Giulia is meeting him for steamy 
but ultimately chaste midnight dalliances in the convent orchard, and counting 
the days until he takes her away. But even as she longs for escape, she finds herself 
drawn to the satisfaction of her personal growth as an artist, and to appreciation 
of the unexpected freedom of expression enjoyed by the sisters. Readers will sense 
before Giulia does that Ormanno is not the man she hopes him to be, and Strauss, 
playing against the customary behind-convent-walls tropes, keeps her audience in 
suspense concerning Giulia’s life decision. The talisman plotline is really an unnec-
essary bit of literary frippery, trumped by a thoughtful and engrossing exploration 
of what true “freedom” might have meant for a woman with talent and ambition 
in sixteenth-century Italy. An historical note on the women artists who inspired 
this story is appended.  EB

Buddy, a people-savvy orange tabby, counsels a trio of kittens on how to make the 
most of their feline assets to win friends and influence people in this tongue-in-

humans are big and loud and kind of scary. But look at them! They’re staring at you 
and making goo-goo noises. . . . Now’s the time to take control!”). Next, he leads 
them through a cat-alogue of felinity’s finer traits, gives them a brief rundown of 
the (mostly Western) history of domestic cats, and describes ways in which cats can 
communicate with and endear themselves to humans (much purring is involved). 
A final spread features a family snapshot of a grinningly posted extended cat family, 
including both exotic felines and domestic breeds. Although the approach to the 
nonfiction content is rather scattershot and occasionally perpetuates questionable 
information (cats don’t in fact always land on their feet), the affable older-and-wiser 
cat is an amusing narrator, and cat lovers will happily recognize both the delights

A young girl declares independence and forms her own nation after her brother 
breaks a vase with a baseball and she gets blamed. Walton lays out steps that one 
must take in order to create one’s own country, such as locating and naming the 
country (the girl dubs her room “Roomvania”), creating a flag, a national anthem, 
and currency, and establishing a citizenry, here represented by a faithful dog, a 
goldfish, a couple of stuffed animals, and a cat who has a visibly laissez-faire at-
titude towards the whole endeavor. Walton cautions readers that “not all will go 
well,” and indeed it doesn’t. Roomvania experiences “civil unrest” (illustrated by the 
dog chasing the cat), “natural disasters” (the frantic dog and cat upset the goldfish 
bowl), and “invasions” (the girl’s brother tries to enter her room), but its illustrious 
leader carries on, eventually accepting an olive branch from the enemy (her brother

friends are more fun than enemies.” Walton’s pithy text and Hargis’s illustrations

view of what it means to be a nation, so adults will find the book doubly useful. 
Hargis’s clever art, scratchily outlined watercolors, make Walton’s words concrete in 
a child-friendly way, and the determined, frizzy-haired little girl, establishing rules 
and printing money with gleeful, if messy, abandon, will win over both kids and 
adults. Readers will also enjoy following the antics of pets, particularly the lanky

Seeing ghosts is an everyday occurrence ever since the cataclysmic Event thinned 
the veil between the physical and spirit world; voiceless images of the dead, whether 
killed by the Event or something else, appear throughout fifteen-year-old Veronica’s 
hometown. Veronica and her mother, for instance, have breakfast each day with 
the silent, unresponsive ghost of Veronica’s dad. The ghost of a teen girl, Mary 
Greer, appears every morning near the house of Veronica’s English teacher, August 
Bittner, because (as some have suspected) he’s the one who killed her many years 
ago. She’s not the only one: in an effort to please the ghost of his wife, who insists 
that their dead daughter, Eva, will come back to life in the body of a girl who 
dies on the anniversary of Eva’s death, August has actually killed several girls, and 
now he’s zeroing in on Veronica. A crime thriller, a ghost story, and a dollop of 
existential philosophy are a surprisingly effective combination here, giving readers 
a taut, suspenseful story arc laced with thoughtful musings on the nature of life, 
death, and memory. The third-person narration shifts among Veronica, Veronica’s 
friend (and would-be boyfriend) Kirk, and August, occasionally interjecting the 
first-person voice of a ghost hoping to warn Veronica of August’s threat. Stalwart, 
practical Veronica holds readers at an arm’s length, but the sorrow she feels over 
her father—and his returning image—is palpable, lending resonance to her discus-
sions with Kirk about death, grief, and the process of moving on. August’s sadness 
echoes her sentiments and makes him oddly sympathetic, even as he is unceasingly 
vicious in his attempts to bring Eva to life. Ultimately, this is a tale of the necessity 
of mourning, and readers who normally find mere titillation in ghost stories will 
instead discover plenty to think about here.  KQG

Little Jenny the mouse and her grandfather spend much of their time together, 
trekking around Boston and going to the beach to look for shells (especially the rare 
and beautiful “queen’s teacup”) while her parents run their busy restaurant. When 
Grandfather dies, Jenny misses him terribly—so much so that she starts following 
other mice that she mistakes for him (“It can’t be him, I told myself, but the pull to 
follow was as irresistible as the current of the sea”). The last of these “Grandfather

sightings” leads her to the sea where she finds “four perfect gold queen’s teacups,” 
which she interprets as a gentle message of love from her departed grandfather. Kids 
who have lost a beloved family member may certainly relate to this, and the compact 
page count and frequent illustrations make this accessible as a longer readaloud for 
younger children as well. Wells’ moving (but not overly sweet) text and Denise’s 
pictures both have a dreamily vintage feel to them, and the piquant textual details 
of Jenny’s world and soft-edged digital illustrations of adorable mice in clothing 
may appeal to readers who love all things miniature. Denise is particularly skilled at 
playing light and shadow against one another and at creating strong compositions, 
as in the picture of a small but robust, suspenders-wearing Grandfather playing 
with tinier Jenny in a shaft of sunlight in their attic home. Those who appreciate 
a more lyrical approach to the loss of an elder may prefer this to the more comic

Jed and his friends despise the Pales, people who have been brought back from the 
dead by a special serum and who are instantly recognizable by their colorless hair, 
skin, and eyes. Raised to believe the Pales should stay dead, Jed is all too happy 
to bully and torture them, joining his friends as they beat up Pale kids who try to 
attend school. After Jed is hit by a car, though, he wakes up as one of the beings 
he’s always feared, with no heartbeat and colorless skin. Abandoned by family and 
friends, Jed is now at the mercy of the very people he used to ridicule. He sets out 
to seek revenge on those who made him a Pale, only to discover that he has to 
accept what he has become or destroy the people he used to care about. A classic 
story of karmic retribution, this short but ultimately satisfying hi-lo novel provides 
readers with the chance to explore provocative ideals mixed with just enough action 
to keep their attention. The strength of Jed’s voice keeps him relatable even when 
he is at his worst and makes his sudden reversal of fortune seem pitiable even as 
it seems just. His narration also renders authentic his transformation from bully 
to self-accepting hero. The science part of the sci-fi is sparse, but it is nevertheless 
successful in creating a believable scenario. With its limited length and concise 
language, this novel is the perfect choice for readers who are looking for an acces-
sible entry-point into the often challenging genre of science fiction, or those just 
craving a swift, thought-provoking story.  AM

Chloe, Kendra, and Sophie are a tight trio, and when new girl Maya arrives, with 
her shabby clothes and obvious desperation, they resist her overtures of friendship. 
As winter turns to spring, the world thaws, but Chloe and her friends refuse to. 
When their teacher leads an exercise about kindness and its effects, Chloe realizes 
she can’t think of any kind act she’s ever done, and when Maya leaves her classroom 
never to return, Chloe realizes that she’ll never be able to rectify her rejection. With 
its absence of redemptive possibility, there’s an Old Testament somberness to this 
story, and Woodson’s fluid writing and deft particularity makes the girls’ bullying 
rebuffs of Maya absolutely heartbreaking. There’s some contrivance here, though, 
December 2012 • 225
in how unrelievedly and publicly awful the class is to Maya (even when she first 
arrives and the teacher tells them to greet her, “most of us were silent”), and how 
the teacher’s sensitive lesson about kindness only appears when it’s too late. In his 
watercolors, Lewis embraces the effects of light like an Impressionist, while his 
creative, often cinematic uses of point of view add resonance to the story. The art 
minimizes the visible differences between Maya and the rest of the multicultural 
cast of kids (which may confuse kids who aren’t seeing what Chloe sees but also 
will highlight the capriciousness of the class’ exclusion), while it also makes Chloe, 
with her pouty stubborn scowl and pink-edged sneaker, into a very plausible and 
realistic little girl. This is perhaps best treated as a parable to provoke discussion, 
and it certainly offers an alternative view to rosier stories of forgiveness and bully-
victim friendships.  DS

Posthumous tributes and collections of published/unpublished works abound in 
the literary world, but it is rare to find one that is put together by an author with 
the foreknowledge that this will be the last exchange she will have with readers and 
critics. After being informed that she had terminal cancer in 2010, noted fantasist 
Diana Wynne Jones set about sorting her manuscripts, eventually pulling together 
this group of essays, lectures, and articles, all of which touch upon her ideas about 
writing fantasy for children. Spanning over twenty years of her literary career, the 
selected pieces are thematically arranged, beginning with the only personal narra-
tive Jones includes, a contemplative piece about watching children at play that sets 
the stage for her subsequent arguments regarding the importance of imagination 
and creativity. Both young and old fans of the author will recognize her deliciously 
wry sense of humor, apparent even in some of the more esoteric pieces such as her 
examination of The Lord of the Rings, and aspiring writers will appreciate this look 
at the inner workings of a literary powerhouse. Neil Gaiman provides a touching 
tribute in his foreword while the book concludes with two pieces written by Jones’ 
children that reflect on the woman as a mother and a writer. Like the author it 
represents, the collection ranges in tone from humorously snarky to somber to joy-
ful and offers an insightful and compelling capstone to Jones’ already impressive 
body of work.  KQG

Imaginary Citizens
Child Readers and the Limits of 
American Independence,  
1640–1868
���������������������
From the colonial period to the end of the 
Civil War, children’s books taught young 
Americans how to be good citizens and 
gave them the freedom, autonomy, and 
possibility to imagine themselves as such, 
despite the actual limitations of the law 
concerning child citizenship. Imaginary 
Citizens argues that the origin and evolution 
of the concept of citizenship in the United 
States centrally involved struggles over the 
meaning and boundaries of childhood. 
In order to contest the patriarchal idea that 
all individuals owed childlike submission to 
their rulers, Americans looked to new theo-
ries of human development that limited po-
litical responsibility to those with a mature 
ability to reason. Yet Americans also based 
their concept of citizenship on the idea that 
all people are free and accountable at every 
age. Courtney Weikle-Mills discusses such 
characters as Goody Two-Shoes, Ichabod 
Crane, and Tom Sawyer in terms of how 
they reflect these conflicting ideals.
$55.00 cloth
“This book is an original and compel-
ling contribution to the history of 
children’s literature, early American 
literary studies, religious studies, 
and politics. Weikle-Mills clarifies 
children’s historical relationship to 
citizenship and shows the way in 
which childhood helped to define 
the very terms of citizenship, es-
pecially as the nation moved away 
from a patriarchal model of subject-
hood to a democratic society.”
