Battle Bunny
by Jon Scieszka and Mac Barnett, and Alex; illustrated by Matthew Myers but 
mostly Alex
Every librarian and teacher has seem them, those saccharine early reader series whose 
desperate inclusion of Things Kids Like is merely a crutch for the didactic intent of 
helping little ones learn sight words and to sound out more complex vocabulary. So 
has Alexander, whose Gran Gran has given him a copy of Birthday Bunny—whose 
“worn” back cover reveals that it’s part of the “Adorable Bunny Collection”—for 
his own special day. The simple, schoolbook story of a bunny who’s sad because he 
believes all his friends have forgotten his birthday doesn’t appeal to Alex, though, 
so he’s spiced it up with plot twists and illustrations all his own.
Scratching out words from the printed text and replacing them with his 
own boisterous vocabulary, Alex has chosen instead to make this book about the 
Battle Bunny, who decides that his birthday is the perfect time to put his Evil Plan 
into action. Battle Bunny forges ahead and destroys each of his enemies (formerly 
Birthday Bunny’s friends): Sgt. Squirrel of the Robot Police Force is taken down 
when his robot killer bees (“Ready to sting your butt and save the forest!!”) are no 
match for Battle Bunny’s chainsaws, and Shaolin Bear and Ninja Turtle’s 1,103 
fighting styles are demolished by Battle Bunny’s 1,104. A scribbled-in president 
(who’s sometimes Barack Obama, sometimes Abraham Lincoln) pleads with a 
doodle Alex to save the day; Alex obliges by revealing that today is also his birth-
day, and Battle Bunny concedes: “[Alex], You have [defeat]surprised me with the 
greatest birthday present[owers].”
It’s a metafictional farce, but it’s wickedly subversive in all the ways that 
will appeal to kids, and it’s remarkably realistic in capturing the inevitable graffiti of 
childhood. The stilted cutesiness of Birthday Bunny is an amusing parody in itself, 
but Alex’s emendation choices are hilariously effective as he deftly repurposes initial 
letters, grammatical markers, and short chunks of text to tell a very different kind 
of story (“‘[F]Greetings[ze], Bunny,’ said Badger. ‘[Stop] Why are you [c]hopping 
so [m]sadly?[!] Today is special day.’[you face El Tejon, the greatest wrestler!!]”). 
The youthful over-the-top hyperbole captures all of the clichés of kids’ action tales 
with gloriously overstated comedy. The resulting text is thus an honest reflection of 
the ways kids interact with books—in a way that’s accessible to kids themselves—as 
well as a complexly layered work of comic genius.
The oil and pencil illustrations of Birthday Bunny are blandly adorable, 
with splotchy lines and muted colors reminiscent of vintage basal reader illustrations 
here set appropriately against pages seemingly yellowed with age. Contrast that art 
with Alex’s additions, which are scratchy doodles in thick black pencil, complete

with speech bubbles and comics-style onomatopoeia, that transform the wide-eyed, 
floppy-eared, and button-nosed bunny into a fierce dictator, complete with angry 
eyebrows, an eye patch, a scar on his ear, and a World Wrestling Federation belt. 
Alex has left no stone unturned—or un-defaced—in this world, with even innocent 
bystanding trees getting marked up with scars or toppled by chainsaw in the wake 
of Battle Bunny’s path of destruction. By the end of the book, Alex’s narrative re-
quirements make Birthday Bunny all but illegible, with one page’s text block near 
the end of the book completely marked out, replacing Birthday Bunny’s moping 
with the president’s interaction with Alex in a graphic narrative.
This is an example of exactly how kids are told not to interact with their 
books—and that’s what makes it so effective. Alex’s gleeful disregard for the inanity 
of Birthday Bunny belies a deep engagement with the words in the book, an active 
participation with the structures of literacy that acts as a rebellious model for kids 
just starting to read on their own. And who can’t help but giggle at a cry of “Time 
to get it on, carrot breath!”? This is, then, sure to be an early reader that’s also 
endlessly entertaining and that will stand up to multiple readings as viewers find 
more of Alex’s hidden gems. Just be on the lookout in library returns for budding 
artists who’ve been inspired to try graffiti of their own. (See p. 239 for publication

In this Santa Claus origin story, the youngest of the Claus children, little red-
snowsuited Santa, likes his family’s life at the North Pole, so he’s dismayed when 
they decide to pack up and relocate to Florida. When a huge snowstorm prevents 
the family from leaving the house, Santa comes to their aid by shimmying up the 
chimney and going for help. Along the way he meets a flying reindeer and some 
helpful, industrious elves who make a sleigh (to be attached to the reindeer) to 
carry Santa, the elves, and some shovels back home to dig the Clauses out. When 
the Clauses eventually carry through with their moving plans, Santa stays behind: 
“And you know the rest of the story.” There’s an amusing edge to the narrative 
voice and to the characters’ dialogue (“Holy snowflake!” exclaims an elf when Santa 
slides down the elves’ chimney) that makes this clever, slightly absurd story great fun 
to read aloud. Agee’s heavily outlined, uncomplicated figures and smooth wintry 
backdrops complement the crisp simplicity of the text, and the muted tones of 
the art provide a fine foil for small Santa in his bright red snowsuit with its peaked 
hood. Santa-loving kids will enjoy picking out the connections between Santa’s

“backstory” and the traditions now associated with the big guy in red, and many 
will also appreciate the ways in which Santa’s characteristics as a family misfit actu-
ally make him well suited to his future occupation.  JH

Omar T-Diddy Smalls is a hip-hop-spouting, football-playing superstar who scores 
as often off the field as on; Claudia Clarke is a done-with-romance, Harvard-bound 
but still dishy activist and future journalist. When his eyes land on her tight jeans, 
his friends bet him $150 that he won’t be able to sweet talk her out of them, and 
the game is on. Fortunately, T-Diddy lives with an uncle who has his own history 
of activism, so he is able to meet Claudia on her own ground, and he parlays his 
power as a leader on the field into the role of accidental community organizer, 
rallying the students of his high school into a successful protest of the budget cuts 
that threaten the school’s arts funding. This is pure and enjoyable urban rom-com: 
of course the protest is successful; of course Claudia falls for T-Diddy; of course 
T-Diddy gives up his playa ways (mostly) for Claudia; of course Claudia and T-
Diddy both get their full scholarships; of course there is a girl fight; and of course 
a heated football rally means someone gets shot but not seriously hurt. While 
nothing unexpected happens and social and economic problems are treated with 
a thoroughly romanticized glaze, style carries the day here: Alexander’s hip-hop 
narration, peppered with FB exchanges, emails, and text messages, is positively 
lyrical and, though the sexual content is clear and explicit, the language is cleaned 
up the way rap lyrics get cleaned up for radio play. Readers looking for an uplifting 
take on subjects usually treated far more heavily will appreciate the jokes as much 
as the silly-sweet romance; teachers looking for urban lit that demonstrates all of 
the formal characteristics of African-American literature in a story contemporary 
students will really relate to and enjoy will find that here as well.  KC

Ten years ago, Janine Collins survived a bombing in Israel that killed her parents; 
at only six years old, she became a household name and a symbol for the possibility 
of faith and recovery. Interest in her fate has only grown since then, in large part 
due to the work of the pastor who pulled her from the rubble and has used the 
event to catapult him into a multimedia faith industry. The ten-year anniversary 
of the bombing, coupled with the increase of faith-based discourse in politics and 
media, has prompted renewed interest, and even Janine’s friends are trying to lever-
age her celebrity for their causes. Janine is unnerved by the attention, particularly 
because she’s not sure what she believes. She and her aunt observe some traditions 
of Judaism, but her experience with tragedy and opportunism has her questioning 
whether a God, especially a loving one, even exists. Meanwhile, her well-honed

and the merit of asserting your personal inclinations against a destiny that others 
have imposed on you. Fortunately, the heady issues are leavened with heart; read-

Spending her childhood with a con-woman mother has left Cassie with a knack 
for reading people, and she’s often able to predict their next actions with almost 
preternatural accuracy. Five years after the brutal and unsolved murder of Cassie’s 
mom, the FBI comes knocking on Cassie’s door, offering her the opportunity to 
join the Naturals, a group of gifted teenagers who work to solve cold cases. Her 
mother’s case is off limits, officially, but when a string of murders occurs, echoing 
the pattern of her mother’s death, Cassie and her newfound pals (including a pair 
of hot guys) find their way around the rules to investigate on their own. From the 
creepy, titillating details of the murders (lipstick souvenirs and peeled-off skin are 
just a few) to the multiple red herrings that effectively lead readers down disturb-
ing blind alleys, this is basically the YA version of a CSI/Criminal Minds/Law and 
Order episode and, like those shows, it has a sort of compulsive appeal that will 
spur readers on, even if the characterization and actual logic of the plot are limited. 
Barnes’ heroines (in The Squad, BCCB 3/08, and Every Other Day, BCCB 2/12) are 
of the sassy, snarky variety and Cassie is no exception, covering much of her grief 
over her mother’s death and her uncertainty about her own abilities with a thick 
layer of sarcastic wit and prickly attitude. The absence of supernatural goings-on 
will draw readers who prefer the no-nonsense of realism, while both the unresolved 
love triangle between Cassie and two fellow Naturals and the deepening mystery 
behind Cassie’s mother promise a sequel.  KQG

Yes, yes, we know that America holds the lead in rampant consumerism, but Bix 
turns from ethical implications and cautionary tales of personal financial mis-
management to a simpler exploration of how, as a nation, we’ve conducted our 
shopping over time. Five chapters take readers from general store and mail order 
shopping, which was once a family experience; to the department store and the 
rise in importance of women consumers; to self-service chain stores, bargain stores, 
and deep discounters; to the many iterations of post–World War II suburban malls; 
and ultimately to our current tensions between brick and mortar stores and cyber-
shopping. There’s less attention paid to advertising, branding, and the psychology 
of recreational shopping than one might reasonably expect from the title, and the 
black and white photo reproductions, particularly of twentieth and twenty-first

century shoppers, fail to convey the enticement of the buying experience to account 
for its hold over American wallets, purses, and credit cards. The tidy organization, 
brief chapter format, and helpful end matter (source notes, bibliography, index, 
and annotated lists for further research) may nonetheless make this a useful title 
for assignments in U.S. History and Consumer Economics classes.  EB

A war between the gods has started, as the deities of ancient Greece begin dying 
and in a desperate bid for survival turn to devour each other. Some, however, put 
aside old grudges and form new alliances: warrior goddess Athena and messenger 
god Hermes bond to save themselves, while sea-god Poseidon joins forces with 
increasingly mad Aphrodite and cruel, power-hungry Hera. Eager for any weapon 
that might help their cause, they crisscross the United States in search of reincar-
nated heroes from their past. Meanwhile, sixteen-year-old Cassandra, the unwitting 
reincarnation of a Trojan princess, finds that her gift for predicting the future has 
warped into painful, grotesque visions of monsters and dying gods, and her loving 
boyfriend has revealed himself to be the god Apollo. Athena’s arrival (with Odys-
seus in tow) additionally awakens memories of war and betrayals, and Cassandra 
is forced to decide if she is willing to set aside ancient hatreds in the face of a new 
common enemy. Deftly reworking ancient myth into a contemporary setting, this 
novel delivers a strong set-up for an intriguing series that is sure to be a hit with 
fans of mythology retellings. Rife with allusions to the Trojan War, it manages to 
provide just enough detail to allow readers unfamiliar with the old tales to follow 
along while not overburdening the text with explanations. The slow, horrific de-
mise of the gods affords plenty of opportunities for Blake to show off her gift for 
gruesome details, but the novel eschews overt horror elements in lieu of building 
momentum toward the final showdown. The focus of much of the action here is the 
battle between the gods themselves, leaving the actual teens relegated to secondary 
roles, but Cassandra really comes into her own near the novel’s end, so readers can 
likely look forward to her becoming a true heroine in future volumes.  AM

At the edge of Bow’s fantasy world stands Westmost, a small village of women who 
bind the souls of the dead and secure the knots of the ward to protect the living 
from the voracious White Hands, shadowy creatures whose mark means certain 
death. As the daughter of the most powerful binder in generations, Otter is next 
in line to inherit the power and responsibility of binding the dead, but one awful 
night changes all that when she’s cast out by her mother. Otter finds solace with her 
friends, Kestrel, a ranger, and Cricket, an apprentice storyteller, until it becomes 
clear that her mother’s power is no longer protecting Westmost but threatening 
it. As in her previous work, Plain Kate (BCCB 2/10), Bow displays the patient, 
rhythmic pace of a seasoned storyteller, and the spare elegance of her prose man-
ages to inspire both chills and tears as the tale requires. Ruled by tradition and 
overshadowed by death, the snowed-in village of Westmost makes an evocative 
setting for three teens to wrestle with their fate, and the details of the vaguely North

heart of this story, however, lies with Otter and her friends and their efforts to come

and their realization that sometimes love does not translate into salvation. Dark 
but ultimately hopeful, this quiet fantasy will leave its mark on readers and have 
them contemplating shadows in a whole new way.  KQG

Cece Maloney’s father, a sound effects man for the radio, always told her he’d get 
her a job at the station as soon as she’s old enough, but now that she’s fourteen and 
has a work permit, Pop has backed off his promise. Mom’s no help; in fact, she’s 
positively overprotective when it comes to most of Cece’s activities. Cece is nothing 
if not determined, however, and she fast talks her way into a Saturday job fulfill-
ing promotional giveaways in the CBS mailroom, works her way into a script and 
news typing position, and even snags a couple of one-off gigs recording background 
whistles and screams. Utterly starstruck, she dreams of a romance with Orson 
Welles and hopes for an audition for a soap opera. Her own life offers plenty of of 
melodrama, though, between Pop’s affair with a radio actress, Mom’s true motiva-
tions for keeping her daughter on a short leash, the real story behind Aunt Nory’s 
apparent fling with an attractive parish priest, and the possibility of a romance of 
her own with Frank, an aspiring reporter at CBS. Cece’s amorous imaginings are 
at once comical and realistically cringeworthy (“Our scripts would brush against 
each other with the crinkly sound of budding romance, and his eyes would peer 
into the depths of my soul, and his voice would broadcast itself into my heart”), 
and the web of fibs and deceits with which she covers her secret employment are 
all the more entertaining for their inevitable doom. Readers in the know will put 
Orson Welles and the 1938 time setting together to anticipate the infamous War 
of the Worlds radio broadcast, but no prior knowledge is needed to enjoy simply 
sprinting along with headstrong Cece and her boundless ambition.  EB

The slat-sided, wooden-wheeled wagon had stood outside the Atlanta antique 
store for some time waiting for a taker. On the day two prospective buyers arrive, 
however, nobody is around to sell it to them. They “borrow” the wagon anyway 
and paint it green, noting that “he would like that.” Two mules are hitched up, 
recalling the old emancipation promise of “a mule and forty acres.” Crowds pack 
the streets outside the Ebenezer Baptist Church, and when the service is over, a 
wooden casket is loaded onto the cart. It rolls through Atlanta to Morehouse Col-
lege, where a second funeral service takes place. Only then is the casket placed into 
a modern hearse that will carry it to interment. The wooden cart is returned to 
the antique store, but now it is a revered artifact, sought by many, sold to the King 
family, and finally installed at the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site. 
Bunting offers her account of Rev. King’s funeral procession with the assumption 
that listeners already know the deceased, and viewers then enter the morning’s

rituals with the reverent curiosity of a child who senses that something momentous 
has just transpired. Tate’s line and watercolor illustrations augment that feeling, 
as he captures in a few deft details the faces of King’s followers who are variously 
saddened, stunned, or numb. It is clear that everyone knows who has passed and 
King’s name is never spoken, making the grief that much more palpable: “The 
cart was not heavy. The coffin was not heavy. The man inside was not heavy. His 
great spirit had been the heaviest part of him. It could not be kept in a coffin.” A 
photograph and brief note are appended.  EB

A little boy and little girl are best friends, until the girl moves away. The boy decides 
to look for her, swimming a river, climbing a mountain, crossing a meadow, and 
so on until he finds her: “Together they played and ran and danced and told each 
other secrets . . . and got married.” The simplicity and imagination of this story 
make it accessible for young children, and there’s an appealing pattern to the dif-
ferent sound effects on each spread of the boy’s journey (“Then all of a sudden, it 
began to rain. Splish! Splash! He had to dash through the falling drops”). The overall 
voyage is contrived, however, and the abrupt wedding is an odd and unnecessary 
conclusion. Carle’s trademark painted tissue-paper collage is bold and bright, and 
the childlike compositions and simple painting techniques offer possibilities for 
imitation to youngsters, while the large, crisp illustrations will be easy to share 
with a large group. An author’s note explains the inspiration for the story: Carle 
left behind a dear female friend when he moved from the U.S. to Germany at age 
six, and that he often wonders what became of her. Despite its shortcomings, this 
is a pleasant look at the power of childhood friendship; it might work well in a 
preschool storytime about friends or one focused on the works of Eric Carle.  JH

Seventy years after the overpopulation crisis transformed the United States govern-
ment into a totalitarian regime ruled by the Hart family, citizens are forced to take 
a test at the age of seventeen to determine their productivity level and thus decide 
their place in society. Kitty Doe manages a lowly III due to her dyslexia, and rather 
than commit to a life of sewer cleaning and spare meals, she decides prostitution is 
her better option. Her first client, however, is none other than Prime Minster Hart 
himself, and he hires her not for sex but to impersonate his niece Lila, whom he had 
secretly murdered for her role in an uprising. With her boyfriend’s life on the line, 
Kitty has no other choice than to go along with the scam, but when Lila’s handsome 
fiancé brings her into the rebellion, she’s unable to resist both him and the chance 
to improve life for everyone, not just herself. A streetwise girl who finds herself the 
symbol of a revolution against tyranny isn’t a particularly groundbreaking premise 
for YA, but Carter interrogates some intriguing notions of class and privilege,

Mei’s father, a silk trader in ninth-century China, will not take her along on his 
journey, but she convinces him to bring a small jade pebble to pass to others on 
the route, in hope that it will reach another child in Italy. Mei’s father concludes 
his business in Turfan, and he hands off the pebble to a monk bound for Kasghar. 
There the monk entrusts the pebble and his own wooden flute to a sandalwood 
trader, who in turn gives a sandalwood box containing those two objects to travel-
ing acrobats in Samarkand, who forward the gifts and a tiny carved elephant to a 
poor traveler in Baghdad. He can only add a cinnamon stick to the box, which is 
stolen by pirates near Antioch. The pirate returns to his home in Torcello, Italy, and 
gives the box of exotic items to his son, who treasures most of all the jade pebble 
from “a girl in the land where the sun rises,” just as Mei treasures a tiny blue stone 
from Italy that her father purchased for her on his travels. Maps of the original 
Silk Road trading sites and the current names of these places help young children 
follow the pebble’s journey, and they illustrate the fact that a typical trek would 
generally constitute only a portion of the route; unfortunately, the journey of Mei’s 
blue stone, traversing the Silk Road from West to East, is less clear. Geometric pat-
terning on buildings and shelters add visual interest, but the doll-like rendering of 
the people who ply their trades along the route are undifferentiated and somewhat 
stiff. An author’s note and a brief bibliography may assist adults in expanding the 
story for young listeners.  EB

Little girl Izzy and her pals, Dish, Fork, Knife, Spoon, Cup, and Napkin, are elated 
when Izzy’s mom decides they can finally set the table themselves. After a few days, 
they shake up the routine and try out new places for everyone, but Izzy’s parents 
require a return to the proper order. Dish and Spoon rebel, running away together, 
sending international postcards to their friends at home, and returning home only 
after Izzy calls them back. Finally, the utensils assume their proper places . . . until 
a pair of friendly chopsticks (friends made on Dish and Spoon’s journey) show up

Headstrong, potty-mouthed Cherry likes her life just as it is, thank you very much. 
She is perfectly happy living in a trailer with her gruff but loving overweight dad 
and her perpetually stoned brother, and she is over the moon when her boyfriend, 
Lucas, asks her to marry him during their senior year, even though neither has 
future plans other than to continue happily in their low-paying jobs. When Cherry 
saves Ardelia, a young British movie star filming on location in their town, from 
choking, though, Ardelia swoops Cherry into her orbit and introduces her to a life 
she never even dreamed about. When Cherry’s trailer burns down, Ardelia makes 
her an offer that could solve all of her family’s money troubles in exchange for her 
services as a surrogate mother. Now Cherry, who has only just started having sex 
with Lucas, has a decision to make that seems fairly straightforward until she learns 
some uneasy truths and realizes how far she has drifted from the girl she once was. 
Cherry is an irresistible heroine: she’s brimming with energy and joyful appreciation 
for the things that really matter, and she’s unafraid of speaking her mind, often in 
vulgar terms, or of suffering the consequences. Despite her protestations, she’s not 
immune to having her head spun a little, but her love for Lucas and her common 
sense never falter (though readers will no doubt cringe when she intentionally 
wrecks the vintage Alfa Romeo Ardelia gives her). Readers will be right there with 
her as she enjoys the perks of being a friend of the obscenely rich and famous while 
calculating the risks and benefits of each decision that would take her away from 
her core values. Her volitional poverty, lack of traditional ambitions, and immunity 
to the popularity game make her a rare bird indeed in contemporary YA, but it’s 
the aplomb she brings to the table that will attract readers of all classes, just as it 
won Ardelia.  KC

Declaring firmly at the outset “This is rat law,” the book explains the rules about 
cheese possession. The result is a litany of who trumps whom in suspiciously 
playground-recognizable hierarchy: “Cheese belongs to you.// Unless a big rat wants 
it. Then cheese belongs to him.// Unless a bigger rat wants it.” Being quicker, being 
stronger, being scarier (or hairier), and, of course, being the boss will all increase 
your cheese access privileges, until finally the whole might-makes-right contest is 
upended by a winner who sweetly shares cheese with the whole competitive crowd. 
Offbeat charm and perceptive youngster psychology effectively combine here in 
a ramp-up that sounds like classic kid one-upsmanship. The rules-lawyering is 
208 • The bulleTin
rhythmic and sonorous as well as conceptually appealing, and the breathlessness 
of the expansions (“If the boss of the biggest, quickest, strongest, scariest, hairiest, 
dirtiest rats wants it . . . ”) is kid-true and readaloud-amusing. Visually, the smooth 
golden hunk of cheese dominates the pages, standing out against blue backgrounds 
(which subtly darken as the book progresses). The rats are a scrabbly collection of 
colored pencil in red touched with black; collectively, they can get a little overbusy, 
but the individual rats are comedic exaggerated figures with cartoonish details (the 
stronger rat is an old-time strongman with curling mustache and striped singlet, 
and the boss wears a sleek top hat and natty plaid trousers). It won’t take much 
to convince kids to come up with their own additional layers of rat-law hierarchy 
(smellier rats? louder rats?), so this could easily become an absurd entry in a language 
arts unit as well as just an entertaining twist on jungle rules.  DS

On Internment, a vast section of the Earth suspended miles above the planet’s surface 
in a protective atmospheric bubble, a small community has managed to flourish 
into a peaceful, safe, and prosperous city. When a young woman is gruesomely 
murdered, however, the king places the entire community under surveillance to find 
the killer. Sixteen-year-old Morgan Atmus wishes she could simply feel safe again 
in the home of her protective family and the arms of her affectionate betrothed. 
Instead, she finds herself intrigued by the victim’s blasphemous writings, which have 
mysteriously started appearing around town, and increasingly unable to resist her 
curiosity about the world below them. Her questioning leads to the discovery of a 
secret society intent on undermining everything her community believes in, and 
Morgan must decide: will she choose a life of safe ignorance, or risk everything for 
a chance to learn what lies beyond the edge? Myth-based world-building creates 
the perfect set-up for this intense, thoughtful novel about the limits of faith and 
reason. Well-crafted and elegantly written, the title offers a well-paced alternative to 
the high-octane, action-centered stories of much recent young adult science fiction. 
Morgan herself is a compelling heroine, more a thinker than a fighter, and the nar-
rative draws readers into her intellectual journey without neglecting its emotional 
and deeply personal impact. A memorable cast of secondary characters, including 
both rebels and true believers, rounds out the story, giving weight to both Morgan’s 
desire for the status quo and her willingness to risk death for a better world. Her 
departure from Internment at the novel’s end may not wrap up the story arc, but 
it creates definite excitement for expected sequels.  AM

The Civil War may be over, but thirteen-year-old Cy realizes too late that he should

down his white friend Travis Strong, who has run away from his abusive father, 
Travis’ father finds them both, Travis makes a break and drowns in the river, and 
Cy is left with all the blame. Mr. Strong hires two neighbors to capture Cy and 
deliver him to the owner of a chain gang who rents out convicts and extra-legal 
abductees for hard labor. Four years later, Cy is a heart-hardened young man who 
resists forming bonds of friendship, or even cooperation, with his fellow laborers. 
As the brutality of their captivity escalates and clandestine relationships between 
owner and workers are revealed, Cy joins the camp cook in a plot to murder their 
captors and free all boys willing to risk flight. Violence, drug addiction, racial slurs, 
and rape are all realistic elements in the tale, and the candor with which this dark

thus suitable for storytimes, where young participants may enjoy predicting the

Charged with being the man of the house in his 1972 small Virginia town after 
his father’s sudden death, Red is trying to figure out how to stop his mother from 
selling their home and his dad’s auto repair shop to relocate the family to Ohio. In 
an attempt to gain support from some older kids, the twelve-year-old unwittingly 
attends a meeting of teenage Ku Klux Klan supporters and is goaded into setting 
fire to a small cross—while his black childhood friend Thomas, bound and beaten, 
is watching from the shadows. Thomas subsequently refuses to speak to his former 
friend, leaving Red to cope with the shame of what he’s done. Layered on top is 
Red’s discovery that his ancestors may have been involved in the theft of land from a 
black church—and the death of the church’s builder. Red is complexly portrayed as 
he grapples with the mourning of a parent, his inability to intervene in the abuse of 
his friend Rosie, the weight of learning from history, and the cultural disorientation 
of the Vietnam era’s changes. However, the speed with which certain plot points 
proceed, like the town’s forgiveness of Red after his cross-burning, and his mother’s 
transformation from soul-crushed housewife to budding feminist, pushes the story 
beyond credibility. There’s also a plethora of tropes here—a plucky young rabble-
rousing teacher and not one but two wise old African-American folks to help Red 
figure himself out—that weaken an otherwise nuanced account of a confused but 
well-meaning tween. Although McMullan’s Sources of Light (BCCB 5/10) is probably 
a stronger exploration of the topic, this could still see some use to spark thought 
on the remaining tendrils of blatant racism in the South post–civil rights.  TA

Allyson is gone, and he must return to his unsatisfactory life in Amsterdam, where

includes lush descriptions of attractive, off-the-beaten-track locales where all one 
needs are a change of clothes and a never-ending bank account to find amazing 
adventures, Willem lacks Allyson’s broad appeal; he’s a bit of hound when it comes

“Get ready for hell,” warns a text sent to Toni as she begins her junior year. She 
knows what it’s about: over the summer she hooked up with Oliver, who was (or 
maybe wasn’t) on a break from class queen Chloe, and now Chloe and her min-
ions want revenge. They get it, too, with a psych-out and bullying campaign that 
culminates in a classic bathroom attack. Strange and chilly schoolmate Cassandra 
helps Toni with the situation by joining with her to cast a spell on Chloe; the spell’s 
horrific apparent result appalls Toni, and she begins to question and fear the dark-
ness she sees in Cassandra. The witchy title and theme will certainly attract read-

(“It’s better to decide that you have powers that you can control than admit you 
got overwhelmed and freaked out and a horrible, horrible thing happened. Better 
evil power than no power at all”). The shifting power dynamic as Toni, initially 
bolstered by her doings with Cassandra, begins to intimidate Chloe is particularly 
well described, but so is Toni’s gradual deeper understanding of Chloe as somebody 
who is fragile and desperate as well as a bully. Fredericks gives Toni a vivid narrative 
voice and character, a girl who credibly enjoys male attention and shrugs at female 
jealousy; her heedless and bubbly best friend, Ella, is both a charming, vulnerable 
figure and an additional window into Toni’s personality. An unusual mix of enticing

Greenberg and Jordan, art chroniclers extraordinaire, continue their tour of Ameri-
can originals with this compact introduction to American potter George Ohr. A 
Barnum-esque eccentric, Ohr became a “Pot-Ohr,” as he punningly termed himself, 
in the late nineteenth century, opening a shop in Mississippi he called “The Biloxi 
Art Pottery Unlimited.” His inventive hand-formed pots were out of touch with 
the style of the time, however, so he eked out a living with novelties and teaching; 
it was only long after his death, when an antiques dealer discovered his wares in 
the 1970s and their reputation grew, that his art was finally accorded the respect 
he always felt it deserved. Ohr is a magnetic character, a rollicking self-promoter 
whose publicity generation was as entertaining as his work was artful, and the 
authors do their usual excellent job at both embedding him in the context of the 
age and making clear how he transcended it. The elegant layout plays gently with 
font, using an aged-print period style for occasional quotes and emphasis. Sepia-
toned photographs of Ohr himself, in vigorous and goofy images very different 
from usual images of the period, are also included along with sharp portraits most 
contemporary of his gleaming pottery. With an endless inventiveness and range of 
style that runs from Nouveau-touched fancies to crumply organic shapes, the pot-
tery will likely be eye-opening for kids who didn’t realize that pots could be made 
to do that. The authors include a generous complement of addenda, including 
information about the Ohr-O’Keefe Museum in Biloxi; a very helpful overview of 
how to artistically assess pottery; a compact description of how to make, fire, and 
glaze a pot; and a bibliography and endnotes.  DS

After a serious car accident and eight months in physical rehabilitation, Ember is 
finally going home. Her relieved parents and devoted best friend, Rachel, are thrilled 
to have Ember back, but Ember is troubled; she has no memory of the accident or 
the six weeks before it, and no recollection of the young man, Anthony, who was 
her passenger and who died in the crash. Returning to her junior year, she delves 
into what’s behind perplexing references to her actions during her blank period, the 
strange friendliness of people she didn’t realize were close to her, and memorabilia 
that takes her to new places. Her search for herself leads her to a mysterious and 
compelling guy, Kai, as well as a growing realization that she had been outgrowing 
some of her old ways before her accident, and that she may not want to stay the 
Ember she’s returned as. There are echoes of the author’s memorable The Other 
Shepards (BCCB 11/98) in this exploration of a girl who’s haunted by a past that 
she can’t experience and that’s overlaying her present. The device of the accident 
adds drama and mystery, but it’s also a very clever way to explore the significance 
of the common teenage experience of redefinition and its impact. The loss Ember’s 
parents and friends clearly felt at Ember’s moving on to new style, goals, company, 
and boyfriend is treated respectfully, but Ember’s reiteration of that change validates 
it as genuine growth and development. Meanwhile, Ember’s tantalizing relationship 
with Kai is exciting but bittersweet, since Griffin hints the truth to readers (he’s 
her memories of Anthony, who was her new and wonderful love) before Ember is 
ready to recognize it. The lure of secret romance and just plain secret secrets will

far from where she should be, whether it’s setting the table or paying attention in 
math class. Her parents’ split saddens her, but her single-word-inspired daydreams 
keep her afloat until she finally decides to put them aside. She then focuses with 
a stern will, but a sensitive teacher, Mr. Spicer, recognizes her unhappiness and 
figures out a way to make her dreaming productive. Grimes’ blend of simple but 
perfectly honed free-verse, shape, and haiku poetry transform Gabby’s familiar

Gabby’s artistic temperament as a gift rather than a distraction, readers, who have 
been privy to her inspired visions all along, will have been convinced from the start, 
and they’ll be eager to try their own hands at turning words into multisensory poetic 
images. Though branding a book with a label of curricular usefulness can often 
signal lesser aesthetic quality, this is most definitely not the case here; Grimes offers 
the complete package of a touching but not overly sentimental narrative, lyrical

Amanda Berr loves the color periwinkle, her Rainbow Sparkle stuffed animal, 
and the thought of playing George Washington in the second-grade presidential 
pageant. She detests competing with newborn twin siblings and a three-year-old 
brother for her parents’ attention, pleading in vain for a fancy-dancy pair of peri-
winkle sunglasses, and having to wear white pants—especially when her polka dot 
underwear shows through and her whole class laughs at her. When her teacher 
assigns the role of George Washington to her arch-nemesis—even after Amanda 
whitens her hair with sugar to more convincingly play the part—she realizes she 
can either admit defeat or embrace her role as pageant narrator. As she learns to 
appreciate her siblings and classmates and relishes an afternoon alone with her 
parents, she adds to her growing set of life lessons, with particular emphasis on 
underwear selection. Gutknecht provides some nice moments of both humor and 
sympathy, and Amanda’s yearning for her parents’ attention and her disappointment 
in not winning the coveted pageant part ring true. The faux-naïve narration and 
mishap-prone character, however, are so derivative of Junie B. Jones as to detract 
from any of this story’s own merits, and the storyline and protagonist fall flat. This 
may, though, serve as a holdover for those independent readers who love Junie B. 
but wouldn’t dream of picking up something with “First Grader” in the title. Final

After her father’s cybercrimes land him in prison, Becca Jones and her mother 
flee Atlanta and their once-privileged lives for a meager existence in Ohio, where 
intrusive reporters and terrifying death threats can’t follow them—provided they 
don’t do anything her father’s enemies could possibly trace. Unable to get close 
to anyone lest they learn the truth, Becca goes through high school with a sim-
mering anger, which she unleashes on her mother, and an unwavering focus on 
her studies; applying to college, however, means she must confront a digital world 
requiring electronic financial aid applications, potentially exposing her whereabouts. 
When a local competition for a full-ride scholarship presents a possible solution 
but instead pushes her to reveal the truth, she learns she is in more danger than 
she ever knew—and it’s time to stop hiding. Author Haddix takes a well-worn 
idea—discovering one’s parents aren’t as they appear—and engagingly weaves in 
modern concerns about pervasive social media and our alarming vulnerability in 
cyberspace. The novel labors to establish its tone and direction, however, and the 
book descends periodically into implausible melodrama. Once it finds its footing 
it’s solidly suspenseful, though, and the themes of love, loyalty, and friendship pair 
with thrilling digital dangers to create a novel both warm and thought-provoking, 
likely to fare well among the web-savvy kids in your library.  AA

The fates of friends Raven Queen and Apple White have already been written in 
the Storybook of Legends, so after two years of prepping for their fairy tale roles, 
it’s only a matter of formally promising on Legacy Day to fulfill their duties as the 
Evil Queen and Snow White before the two girls can live out their story. As Legacy 
Day approaches, however, Raven grows increasingly uncertain about becoming the 
“Greatest Evil There Ever Was,” and she’s shocked to discover that some characters 
have rebelled against their stories in the past. Meanwhile, Apple finds herself torn 
between helping her friend figure out a way to change her destiny and ensuring 
her own happily ever after. Neither as dark nor complex as Chainani’s similarly 
premised The School of Good and Evil (BCCB 6/13), this middle-grade fantasy is 
a good deal more compact and has occasional bits of lighthearted humor that gear 
it toward younger readers not quite ready for School’s 400+ pages. The action is 
fairly mild, but both Raven and Apple are likable heroines; with her zingy wit and 
self-deprecating humor, Raven is credibly vulnerable as a girl trying to figure out 
exactly who she is if she’s not the person others believe her to be, while Apple’s 
genuinely kind heart lends her perfectionist persona a bit of warmth and acces-
sibility. Fairy-tale fans will delight in trying to puzzle out which classmates are the 
offspring of various fairy-tale characters, while the pop culture references revised 
in Ever After terms (Taylor Swift is Tailor Quick here, while One Reflection’s big 
hit is “You Don’t Know You’re Charming”) give the book a clever timeliness.  KQG

R 5-8 yrs
In the latest of Hartland’s museum series titles (How the Sphinx Got to the Museum, 
BCCB 12/10), students on a class field trip learn what happened to the Peekskill 
Meteorite from its fiery descent through Earth’s atmosphere to cozy installation at 
the American Museum of Natural History. The explanation kicks off in the teacher’s 
speech bubble, and then continues in the main text with a discussion of asteroids, 
meteors, and meteorites, and eventually launches into a cumulative “House That 
Jack Built”–styled narration of this particular space scrap’s encounter with Earth. 
The meteorite is barked at by a dog in Kentucky, spotted by burger eaters in Virginia 
and high school football fans in Pennsylvania before it crashes into the trunk of 
a teenager’s Chevy Malibu in Peekskill, New York. Nobody’s hurt, but the police, 
firefighters, geologists, museum curators, cosmologists, and an exhibits team all 
take a hand in identification, procurement, and interpretation of the meteorite 
before it is sliced up and settled in at museums and labs. The sheer strangeness of 
a rock making an interplanetary journey into a parked car will rivet a young science 
audience, and Hartland’s combination of support information and zippy, slightly 
askew cartoon artwork are a pleasure for group sharing. Even the oft-neglected end 
matter is worth visiting, as it takes on issues of ownership (yes, the teenager owns 
the meteorite, and it’s made her enough money to replace the car), possible reasons 
for the meteor’s diversion off course, and the likelihood of other collisions (millions 
of tons of space debris daily—eek!) This will make a fine classroom readaloud, but 
perhaps a not so settling bedtime story.  EB

Accidentally transforming three birds into humans has landed the Baldwin sisters in 
some serious hot water with the Council of Unnatural Events, and the two witchy 
sisters decide that their eleven-year-old neighbor Fortuna Dalliance can help them 
out of it. Fortuna is charged with the task of looking after Martin, one of the bird 
tranformees, and convincing him that he should want to return to his bird form 
(apparently a requirement for the reverse spell to work). Fortuna, however, thinks 
Martin should be human and remain her friend, especially when Martin and his 
bird brother, also transformed, teach Fortuna how to fly. The whimsy of the premise 
holds great appeal for fans of cozy fantasies, and the witches here give the magical 
nemesis of Clover Twig (in Umansky’s Clover Twig and the Magical Cottage, BCCB 
10/09, etc.) a run for her money in the categories of comical incompetence and 
snarky wit. Unfortunately, the storytelling doesn’t match Umansky’s, and behavior 
is too often driven by plot necessity rather than genuine character—it’s never quite 
explained, for example, why the Baldwin sisters chose Fortuna, nor does Fortuna’s 
sudden attachment to Martin feel anything more than convenient to the story, 
especially when she initially finds him strange and annoying. A subplot following 
an old crow’s efforts to get the bird boys back into their proper form will please 
animal-loving kids, however, and the humorous bumbling of the witches will likely 
inspire more than a few amused cackles.  KQG

Drought has hit the African plains, wiping out all vegetation except for one lush 
fruit tree. A vigilant python encircles its trunk, permitting a taste of the fruit only to 
those who know the tree’s name. Hungry and desperate, Elephant, Giraffe, Zebra, 
Monkey, and Tortoise decide to seek the answer from the king of the jungle. One 
by one they journey to the lion, learn the name of the tree, and promptly forget it 
as they travel home. All that is, except Tortoise, who makes up a clever rhyme to 
remember “Bojabi.” Ideal for storytimes, this African folktale (with source note) 
makes effective use of repetition and invites melody to engage listeners. Grobler’s 
line and watercolor illustrations employ slender, edgy lines that give the animals a 
sophisticated goofiness, while the subtle earth-toned palette, mostly spots and planes 
against the white background, is enlivened by amusing detail and the injection of 
text into the art. Simple and celebratory, this story will fare especially well among 
a group who loves proving all they can remember.  AA

Little Red, a red pencil at Pencil School, embarks on a story-writing assignment, 
equipped with the advice “to stick to your basic story path so you don’t get lost” 
and a basket of words to use in case of trouble. Although Little Red begins well, 
she soon ends up in “a deep, dark, descriptive forest,” so she pulls out the word 
“scissors” and cuts her way out. A strange growling then causes her to fling more 
words and flee, but when she notices a tail (an appliance plug on a cord) she follows 
it to Principal Granny’s office to find a computer-like machine. Though the thing 
initially purports to be Principal Granny, it eventually reveals itself to be the Wolf 
3000, a powerful pencil sharpener who has sharpened Principal Granny down to 
a stub. Little Red throws her last word—“dynamite”—at the Wolf 3000 and blows 
it to smithereens, thus rescuing Principal Granny and giving Little Red an exciting 
conclusion to her assignment. This is an original and action-filled concept, but the 
story-writing instructional hints feel forced, the plot is rather tangled, and Red’s 
tool words are too often contrived and convenient. Sweet’s watercolor, pencil, and 
collage artwork is a whole lot of fun, though, and the details of the pencil-inhabited 
world are charming if a bit cluttered. Enterprising English teachers willing to give 
a little added guidance may find this the most useful, and storytime leaders or 
school librarians may enjoy pairing this with Ahlberg’s The Pencil (BCCB 9/08)

hotel, manage to smuggle the Yetis out of Tibet with the help of Con’s sister, Ellen, 
and an animal-loving lorry driver named Perry. Unfortunately, the Yetis arrive at 
Lady Agatha’s former home to discover the manor house is being rented by a hunt-
ing club, the vicious members of which promptly drug the Yetis and ship them off 
to Antarctica so that the club can then hunt them. Con, Ellen, and Perry learn of 
this action too late to stop the Yetis’ removal, but they launch a protest outside the 
palace to try to get the Queen to put a stop to the hunt. Will they succeed? Will 
the Yetis be saved? This is Eva Ibbotson, so of course the answer is a satisfying “Yes,” 
with the likable heroes and even more endearing Yetis afforded a well-deserved 
happy ending. The writing is skillful, precise, and frequently funny, and it offers 
an effective counterbalance to some of the story’s more serious social criticism, as 
Ibbotson roundly denounces hunting and bullfighting (which the crew encounter 
as they take a detour through Spain). Robinson’s smooth, monochromatic illus-
trations, which appear frequently throughout, add warmth and playfulness to the 
text. This will be an easy sell to Ibbotson or creature fans, and many of the events 
concerning ethics and animal treatment would make good discussion starters.  JH

In this ambitious work Jenkins moves beyond nature picture books to a more com-
prehensive look at animal life in general, in a size and format to entice browsers, 
report writers, and voracious readers alike. Material is organized in seven chapters, 
covering animal taxonomy, family life, senses, predators, defenses, “extreme” traits, 
and evolution. Subheadings guide researchers quickly to their topic of choice, but 
the chunks of text are short enough to encourage kids to complete entire sections. 
Arrays of cut-paper collage animals with short annotations fill most spreads, but 
each chapter also boasts a double-page spread with a visual surprise (e.g., a swarm 
of termites, an oversized close-up of an exploding Malaysian ant, a startling life-
sized view of a Siberian tiger’s face), as well as at least one chart or diagram that 
allows readers to compare relevant information for the topic. An excellent glossary 
is included, along with a lengthy section of “More Animal Facts,” alphabetically 
organized into a sort of mini encyclopedia. The most clever bonus item, though, 
is a collaged section on how Jenkins makes his books, from concept, through 
research, writing, revision, and illustration, to completion. This will be an ideal 
holiday gift for kids who love animals or who love Steve Jenkins books—and that

desk job at the Ghost Bureau, Lapsewood finds himself roaming the streets in 
search of a missing ghost only to discover that houses all over the city have inexpli-
cably lost their hauntings and fallen victim to the Black Rot. With the help of an

unexpected sidekick, young ghost Tanner, and his pack of spirit dogs, Lapsewood 
must unravel the mystery of the Black Rot before it starts to harm the living world. 
Meanwhile, fourteen-year-old Sam Toop, the undertaker’s son with a gift for talk-
ing to ghosts, has problems of his own to solve, including the sudden appearance 
of his murderous uncle Jack. When a favor for a recently deceased neighbor lands 
him in a church infected with Black Rot, Sam is drawn into Lapsewood’s quest, 
where he meets fifteen-year-old Clara Tiltman, an adventurous upper-class girl who 
may just hold the key to the mystery. With its Dickensian overtones and enormous 
cast of characters, this novel offers a pleasing mixture of quirky amusement and 
pulse-quickening scares. The central characters are all eminently likable in their 
way, and readers will root for them to come together to beat the various dastardly 
villains who contribute to the plague of Black Rot. Some villains are established at 
the beginning while others are revealed late in the story, giving readers insight into 
what’s going on and a few surprises as well. A handful of ghosts perish (again) in 
wrenching detail, but the novel as a whole is light on gore, making it the perfect 
choice for readers ready to graduate from Gaiman’s The Graveyard Book (BCCB 
10/08), but not quite willing to take on genuine horror.  AM

Trouper started out as a street dog, running with a pack of mutts and dodging the

nabbed by Animal Control and put up for adoption, and everybody in the pack 
finds a home before Trouper. Finally, though, a young boy takes Trouper to his 
heart and to his home, where they revel in a life together and outings where they 
“leave five footprints in the snow.” There’s obvious sentimentality here (“My heart 
was a cold, starless night”), but the spare text, occasionally patterned with subtle 
rhymes, gives it maximum effect with minimal flourish. The human portraiture is 
sometimes awkward, but Lewis’ translucent, light-filled watercolors offer eloquent 
doggy portraiture, with Trouper sprawling inelegantly and adorably on his back or 
peering over the edge of the bed with his ears at an irresistible droopy angle. Com-
positions, especially those drawing on the geometry of the chain-link kennels, are 
creative and dramatic, while the play of light and dark maximizes the touchability 
of Trouper’s soft black coat. Get ready with a bouncy follow-up and some Kleenex, 
because this will move animal-loving kids from tears of grief to tears of joy.  DS

The title may prioritize dogs, but these three historical fiction stories in this graphic

different wars. In “Boots,” sixteen-year-old Marcellinus McDonald is a doctor’s 
assistant on the Western Front in 1914, and Boots is his beloved “mercy dog,” 
who finds the wounded in No Man’s Land. “Loki” is a sled dog in a rescue unit 
stationed in 1942 Greenland, where his master relies on him in a solo encounter 
with some reconnoitering Nazis. The final story, “Sheba,” follows young Henry 
in 1968 North Carolina as his struggles with his obstreperous beagle pup bring 
him friendship with a recently returned Vietnam vet haunted by his experience 
on patrol with his German shepherd, Sheba. Keenan creates vivid voices for her

characters, effectively tucking in exposition to convey information about everything 
from military objectives to daily life details in three very different situations. There’s 
action aplenty, but the rhythms and trajectories vary effectively: “Boots” is a classic 
story of the Christmas Truce; “Loki” is an adventure tale of intelligence and hand-
to-hand combat; “Sheba,” which could stand alone as a book in its own right, is a 
poignant tale of male bonding between a young fatherless African-American boy 
and a black soldier overwhelmed by his experiences. Though the chaos of the ac-
tion scenes can make them difficult to read, the art is atmospheric and effective, 
blending cinematic heroism, especially in the portraits of the dogs, with often 
daunting realism. Diehard warmongers, dog fans, and graphic-novel readers will

Being uprooted from West Virginia to Tennessee isn’t Savannah’s idea, but she has 
to admit that her new life on a fine Thoroughbred farm isn’t all bad. Since her 
father’s the head groom, she has a shot at being first an exercise rider and then a 
jockey; more significantly, Jack Goodwin, the seventeen-year-old son of the owner, 
is seriously hot and clearly interested in Savannah. Skeptical Savannah is torn: she 
knows Jack’s reputation as a player, her vulnerability as his employee, and the class 
divide between them, but her heart (and loins) won’t allow her to give up hope. 
With Catching Jordan (BCCB 2/12) and Stealing Parker (BCCB 1/13), Kenneally 
has established herself as a writer of romances with some interesting complexity 
along with the swooning, and there’s certainly plenty of swooning and steamy 
pleasure here. Additionally, Savannah herself is genuinely brash and not just saucy, 
and the Tennessee milieu is vividly evoked. The richness of the other books is 
absent, though, leaving the story too often formulaic. The professional issues are 
brushed off more as Savannah’s defensiveness than a genuine problem, and Jack is 
actually a pretty flat character, much less interesting than Savannah’s platonic male 
friend Rory. Additionally, the book lacks the smooth familiarity with the racing 
world that Jordan had with football, with the details unrealistic and the behavior 
and terminology too often ringing false. Fans who are in it for the banter and the 
physical magnetism, though, may still find plenty of enjoyment in the no-question-

This companion title to Explorer: The Mystery Boxes (BCCB 6/12) brings back sev-
eral contributors and introduces a few new artists, who collectively focus on short 
graphic stories with an island setting. The first three entries are the strongest: Jake 
Parker offers a charming parable of a village of bunnies who discover that robot 
assistance is good, but participation in island life is even better. Chrystin Garland 
contributes a visually stunning morality tale on a girl’s terrifying brush with death at 
an island carnival, while Jason Caffoe’s tale is a mini adventure in which a castaway 
boy finds an unusual way to help the ghost and exoskeleton of a giant crab return 
to the sea. The remaining four stories, which range from standard teen rebellion 
woes to the efforts of a drifting radio station deejay to hatch a pixie egg, are less 
involving, unfortunately, and they suffer from flat, fizzled endings or heavy-duty 
moralism. Variety of style is the real draw of Kibuishi’s graphic anthologies, and 
tweens reluctant to stray from their comic-book favorites will find the gamut of vi-
sual presentations eye-opening (Garland’s jewel-toned, Fantasia-esque extravaganza 
contrasts sharply with Parker’s Golden Book throwback bunnies.) This short-work 
exploration of the strange may capture the imagination of kids a year or two shy

The challenge in Krull’s latest Giants of Science entry is not adding to information 
about the redoubtable Founder but selecting and paring information down to the 
scope of the series. The effort is successful, reframing Franklin’s portrait from that 
of statesman with an interest in science to that of a natural philosopher impelled 
by patriotic loyalty to often answer the call of public service. Krull is skillful at con-
densing the non-scientific aspects of Franklin’s biography and bringing his scientific 
enthusiasms and achievements to the foreground, particularly his experiments in 
electricity which garnered him international acclaim. Technical explanations are 
admirably clear (especially discussion of why common portrayals of the famous 
kite experiment are misleading), and even when Franklin’s legion of inventions are 
expressed as lists, readers will enjoy many of the lesser known inclusions (the first 
flexible urinary catheter . . . who knew?). Kulikov again supplies his distinctive 
hatched pen and ink drawings and offers an engrossing gallery of imaginative takes

concluding scene. Fans of this well-established series will welcome this new title

Brian’s Phoenix high school may be surrounded by an electrified fence, but that 
doesn’t stop him and his friends from cutting class. When they return for drama class 
(an easy A), they find the school in the grip of a virus that transforms its victims into 
pain-ridden, necrotic monsters seeking living bone marrow to munch on and turns 
their campus into a grisly delicatessen. With the place in chaos, their only chance 
of survival is to stay barricaded in the drama department until help arrives. Their 
sense of duty won’t allow that, though, because Brian’s sister, in remission from 
leukemia, and his ex-girlfriend, who suffers from panic attacks, are somewhere in 
the school in need of rescue. Leveen hauls out all the teen horror-movie conventions 
and salts them with a healthy dose of hypermasculine homophobia, which must 
of course be overcome because our heroes are allied, after all, with the drama kids. 
The action is fast and full of phantasmagoric details, and there are those obligatory 
moments of tender revelation, promises to kill each other if things get too bad, and 
don’t-you-quit-on-me responses that horror fans have come to expect in their pre-
ferred genre. The usual nods are made to diverse casting, but there are no surprises 
about who lives, who dies, and who emerges heroic in the end. There is surely a 
sufficiently large readership for these tried-and-true tropes to warrant its inclusion 
in a collection, and fans will get what they came for, if, literally, nothing else.  KC

Illinois is a new home for Sophie Sophia and her mother, who have a habit of 
packing up and moving whenever there’s something they’re trying to get away 
from. These days they’re trying to get away from Sophie’s “episodes,” where she 
hallucinates events—admittedly, quirky, interesting, and often enjoyable events—
that aren’t actually happening. The escape plan is a failure, since Sophie begins 
sophomore year with a vision of an all-panda marching band; she does, however, 
make an immediate best friend of Finny, a boy who’s besotted with physics and 
therefore thrilled that Sophie’s estranged father is a famous physicist. Since Dad 
also experienced reality-bending episodes, Sophie decides it’s time to find him 
again after his leaving the family four years ago, so she and Finny take off to New 
York to find Angelino Sophia and his story. Luna has a vibrant, quotable style that 
gives Sophie’s narration considerable charm, and Sophie’s longing for her beloved, 
if unpredictable, father is poignantly expressed through her flashbacks to her life 
with him. The story stumbles, however, on plotting: Sophie’s string-theory-based 
hypothesis that her episodes are travels into a parallel universe is insufficiently 
explanatory, and the book teeters awkwardly between realism and speculation, 
acknowledging the possibility of hallucinatory illness but brushing it off. Addition-

It’s April, 1912, and everyone from the humblest steerage passenger to the haugh-
tiest first-class passenger excitedly settles onboard for the transatlantic maiden 
voyage of the world’s most luxurious, indestructible ship, unaware of what every 
reader already knows—this ship is doomed. It’s not the Titanic, though, but the 
airship Dakota, and its nemesis is not an iceberg but the shadowy family histories 
of the Dakotas and the Castors. Hollis Dakota, age thirteen, is heir to the airship 
company established by his grandfather, Samuel, who discovered the secret of flight 
(involving moonshine, tree sap, and beetles), and sold that secret to the Union 
Army to end the Civil War in 1862. Hollis’ mother married Jeff Castor, now the 
ship’s chief operating officer, following her husband’s death, and Hollis continues 
to be best friends with Castor’s teenage son, Rob. That friendship is sorely tested, 
though, when Castor hijacks the newly christened Wendell Dakota with the help 
of disgruntled ex-Confederates and eerie beetle-worshiping cultists. As the boys 
discover that each family has a larcenous skeleton in the closet, they must strike 
an agreement to cease domestic hostilities and land the battered airship and its 
passengers safely. Marino’s tale will certainly delight Titanic enthusiasts, who will 
easily catch the many parallels he draws between the real and fictional ships. There’s 
also a lot on offer for steampunk fans, such the details of keeping the ship aloft 
on insect flatulence, and for anyone who likes a well-told adventure in which the 
family mystery is cleverly interwoven among breakneck action scenes.  EB

A glittering cast of YA authors and one beloved illustrator, Charles Vess, bend and 
blend the traditional and the contemporary to sometimes dazzling effect in these 
twelve original tales and six illustrations inspired by literary classics. In Melissa 
Marr’s capable hands, Kate Chopin’s Edna (from The Awakening) becomes a selchie; 
in Neil Gaiman’s entry, Snow White leads several of her dwarves on a quest to 
liberate a sleeping princess and herself. Rick Yancey traces the tragedy of humans 
attempting to play God through his reinterpretation of Hawthorne’s “The Birth-
Mark” in a haunting posthuman fantasy, while Carrie Ryan engages a different 
type of dystopian religious cli-fi vision that echoes Forster’s “The Machine Stops.” 
Classic horror inspires many of the authors, while others are captivated by fairy 
tales and more involved fantasies, such as Spenser’s The Faerie Queene. The plot 
“skeletons” were chosen by their authors for reasons they articulate in post-story 
notes, but really, there are no rags and bones here; each of these stories and illustra-

The creeping, tentacled shadows that follow Maggie’s new stepdad around have 
the seventeen-year-old girl worried. Since she’s the only one who can see them, 
they might mean that she’s going crazy or, even worse, that she has the ability to 
see and possibly interact with magic, a big no-no in the science-focused, magic-
abolishing state that is Newworld. Before she can decide whether or not to go to 
the authorities, however, a “cobie,” a cohesion break in Newworld’s reality, sends 
everyone into a panic, and Maggie discovers that the shadows are actually quiet 
friendly little critters, her stepdad is an Oldworld magician (and a powerful one 
at that), and that her magical powers might mean she’s the only one standing be-
tween Newworld and its demise. This is a tricky combination of genre tropes—a 
Big Brother–type of dystopian government, a clueless but powerful savior from 
fantasy, and the interpersonal dynamics of a family drama—but McKinley crafts 
them all with a deft hand, spooling out each element with a careful deliberation 
that allows them to coalesce into a fully formed story. Intricate world building is 
matched with rich characterization; a bit moody, a bit flighty, and all teenager, 
Maggie makes a relatable protagonist, and her wisecracks and astute observations 
help readers gain ground in this eerily familiar but nonetheless complex world of 
old magic, new science, and breaks in reality. The secondary cast, including the 
requisite dual love interests, are afforded depth and nuance as well, rounding out 
the setting for the ensuing emotional drama. Fans of McKinley will recognize her 
penchant for animal-human connections in Maggie’s affectionate guardianship 
of the shadows, while other readers will find this a compelling entry point to the 
author’s work.  KQG

Dinah always supported her sweet, naïve fourteen-year-old cousin Claire, so when 
Dinah moved across the country, Claire was left to her own devices. Now Claire’s 
in a coma and Dinah’s determined to find out why. When she reads in Claire’s di-
ary that Claire fell hard for a boy who then raped her, Dinah seeks revenge on the 
guy. She is abetted by an able pair of allies, who come up with a slate of subtle but 
diabolically effective sabotage efforts to slay the guy’s chances at the choice colleges 
that represent the only future his overbearing father will accept. Narrator Dinah’s 
steadfast adherence to her plans undermines her better angels and instincts, and 
she makes a serious error in judgment that readers will see coming a mile away. 
Though the story is compulsively readable, the credibility gaps in most of the plot 
points are as problematic as the predictable outcomes and clichéd, two-dimensional 
characterizations. Many readers, however, will overlook these flaws in favor of the 
appeal and cleverness of the revenge plan and the mystery that is obvious enough 
for them to solve long before the protagonist does. The dialogue is witty and the 
pacing works, even if Claire’s situation is dramatically overplayed and the villain—
rapist, blackmailer, coward, homophobe—lacks only a mustache to twirl to be a 
full-fledged caricature. Readers who enjoy melodrama that doesn’t demand anything

Ever since Evan lost his virginity at fifteen to the Cupcake Lady of Tacoma, he has 
honed his instincts to pick out the girls who are sure things in each new place he 
moves to. At his latest boarding school, though, Collette is the one who seduces 
him, and he ends up receiving a savage beat-down by two boys who feel he’s en-
croached on their territory—territory they further mark by then raping Collette. 
Evan and his father move to his father’s childhood cabin in Minnesota so that Evan 
can recover physically and mentally. He also meets a girl who makes him want 
more than a physical connection, and eventually, he has to come to terms with the 
fact that he has never really had a genuine friend, and that all the sex in the world 
can’t make up for the loss of his mother and his inability to connect to his own 
feelings, much less anyone else’s. The only judgment passed here on frequent and 
random hook-ups is Evan’s self-recrimination; haunted by what happened to him 
but more by what happened to Collette, he struggles to not be the guy he once was, 
even though sex still offers a potent distraction from uncomfortable feelings. His 
conversations with the girl next door open him to new, sometimes heartbreaking

with him not only as a victim of violence but also as a victim of the lonely vacuum

“I was alive, alone, and trapped in the body of a dead person.” So says our name-
less narrator, who comes to consciousness in just as teenaged Dan is leaving said 
body after slitting his wrists. What’s odd, though, is that each awakening brings 
the narrator and Dan to the previous day, so that together they go back in time to 
uncover what led Dan to this desperation: his interest in a girl who is raped at a 
party he invites her to, a situation that spirals down every time he attempts to help 
and support her. The narrator despises Dan, seeking to make him a better person 
and maybe avert his eventual suicide, but he soon realizes that he’s actually moving 
Dan toward the very outcome he’s trying to prevent. The writing often tells rather 
than shows, tending toward the melodramatic at times, and it’s initially difficult 
to get past the unsympathetic personalities of both Dan and the narrator. As the 
days continue backward, however, the story becomes more interesting, and the fact 
that the narrator is, though he doesn’t initially realize it, the spirit of Dan himself, 
provides an unusual perspective on what is essentially his self-loathing and also 
on the random and conflicted thinking that can bring a teenager to the precipice. 
The result frames the fatalistic thinking of depression in a fresh way, making this 
a thoughtful read and a provocative title for discussion.  DS

Captain Cat, nicknamed for the large number of felines he keeps aboard his trad-
ing ship Carlotta, lands with his crew on a remote island. The child queen of the 
island is thrilled to meet the cats, the first she has ever seen, and even more thrilled 
that they quickly dispatch the rats in her castle: “‘Oh, well done, you clever, clever 
cats!’ cried the Queen with delight as she inspected the neat rows of corpses lined 
up on the Royal Palace floor.” The Captain agrees to trade his cats for jewels and 
returns to his home port; his fellow traders, impressed with his riches, seek out the 
island to hawk their own wares but are hugely disappointed to receive in turn the 
queen’s finest treasure: cats. Back home, they give their “payment” to Captain Cat, 
who embarks on his travels with renewed spirits and makes his way back to the 
delightful island, now well populated with his cats’ offspring. Moore excels at visually 
creating idyllic worlds (as in A House in the Woods, BCCB 12/11), and this title is 
no exception. Both the cozy Carlotta and the beautiful island are charming places, 
and cat-loving kids will be beside themselves poring over the spreads featuring the 
numerous cats of all colors and patterns. The mixed-media art features Moore’s usual 
delicate engraving-line stipple, hatch, and crosshatch in partnership with informal 
and rather jolly draftsmanship in faces and figures; the numerous details in her rich 
scenes invite close inspection. The story finds its inspiration in an old Italian tale

This rhyming picture book in two voices follows a brother and sister with opposing 
views about winter: “Winter is for wonderful!/ Winter is for snow!” says the boy, 
but his sister responds, “Winter is for cold and damp./ It must be ten below!” The 
boy continues to rhapsodize, with the occasional flying fancy about sled dogs and 
penguins, and finally succeeds in coaxing his sister out to the local sledding hill, 
which converts her to a snow-lover. While the dual-voice structure, with the boy’s 
dialogue in black text and the girl’s in brown, offers readaloud and performance 
possibilities, the text is too often strained both in vocabulary and scansion. There’s 
an amiable cartoonish vigor to the illustrations, though, with the thick dark lines 
touched with digital color and softly patterned snowflakes. The girl’s subtly changing 
face hints at her waning resistance to the season, helping ground what otherwise 
seems like a fairly sudden shift. Winter-haters may appreciate having an acknowledg-
ment, however brief, of their point of view, and the opportunity for some wintry 
theater may ironically amuse those youngsters stuck inside due to the weather.  DS

In 1847 engineer Charles Ellet, Jr. set out the challenge for an enterprising kite flier 
to lay out the first line across the Niagara River at the site at which he was commis-
sioned to build a bridge. Irish immigrant teenager Homan Walsh managed to send 
his octagonal calico kite from the Canadian to the American shore in the dead of 
winter, thereby winning a ten-dollar prize and bragging rights to completing the 
first step in the construction of the international bridge. O’Neill recreates Walsh’s 
feat based on clues from period documents and memories from Walsh himself late 
in his life. The story is a fairly loose treatment, with imagination filling in historical 
gaps, but the author meticulously distinguishes fact from speculation in her lengthy 
closing note. Walsh narrates his first failed and second successful attempts with a 
rhythmic cadence that will be a pleasure for reading aloud: “Then suddenly, a sag, 
a jerk./ The heavy line went slack!/ It snapped on ice below./ No kite./ No cord./ 
No union.” Widener’s acrylic scenes make the most of the contrast of weather and 
terrain, contrasting the golden warmth of Walsh’s nights indoors making his kite 
with the chilly steel blues and grays of the ice-clogged river and snow-frosted banks.

For this series, Nigerian author and photographer Onyefulu takes her camera to 
Mali to provide a simple visual landscape of everyday things in West Africa for the 
youngest audiences. In each book, a framed photograph with large text describ-
ing the object or activity faces a full-page photograph that shows it in action. The 
photographs are neatly composed and show careful attention to detail in depicting 
the word in question, and they also display genuine warmth in their portrayal of the 
lives of Malian people. Of the two, Home is the stronger title, with its juxtaposition 
of household staples like stools and cooking pots against photos of their actual use 
more effective than the photographs in Play, which are often two nearly identical 
pictures of children playing games like a ay (a game in the Songhai language that 
involves mirroring one’s opponent) or hopscotch, and which sometimes leave ques-
tions as to how the game is actually played. A brief note from the author begins 
each volume, giving enough cultural background so that adults sharing these simple 
readalouds can answer the inevitable “why’s” sure to result from flipping through 
the rich visual compositions, giving these an opportunity to diversify the youngest

On his eighteenth birthday, Jack is depressed to the point of contemplating a suicide 
attempt, not with the goal of killing himself exactly, but just to draw people near. A 
phone call from his estranged girlfriend changes his plans: he heads to the hospital 
where she’s giving birth so he can meet the newborn son he didn’t want and then 
say goodbye to the baby before he’s adopted. Once there, Jack can’t bring himself 
to let go, and he escapes with the baby and a makeshift plan to somehow make an 
impression on his son before he gives him up for adoption. His plan expands to 
include his best friend, Tom, who is leaving for the army, and Jess, the baby’s mother, 
and he even works out a destination, his grandmother’s house. The odyssey is more 
metaphor than literal, so its improbability is forgivable; underneath it is an accessible 
meditation on what it means to grow up and work through isolation. Jack, Jess, 
and Tom are each haunted by the prospect of being alone, of entering adulthood 
without the capacity to form meaningful relationships. Jack in particular is of an 
inveterately philosophical turn of mind, and he engages in imagined conversations 
with his infant son, whom he names Socrates and endows with an ability to call 
Jack out on fuzzy thinking. Father and son dwell on the kinds of existential ques-
tions that thoughtful teens ask during dark nights of the soul, about the meaning 
of existence, the importance of one person in the world, what it means to move 
through time and space, and the nature of God and his role in evil and free will. 
In addition to those contemplations is the witty and stylized dialogue between the 
three teens that recalls the characters of John Green and David Levithan; readers 
who enjoy those authors will find themselves at home here.  KC

Best friends since they were kids, Kai and Ginny have big plans now at seventeen

hold, however, when Kai’s eccentric grandmother dies and a mysterious girl shows 
up, seducing Kai, who then breaks up with Ginny and takes off in the middle of a 
snowstorm with the other girl. The last words of Kai’s grandmother lead Ginny to 
believe that this isn’t simply a case of Kai’s feelings changing, and she sets off after 
him, following a series of clues that lead her into a world where monsters disguise 
themselves as men, girls lose their souls at the bottom of the sea, and a queen with 
a heart of ice lies at the center of it all. While not part of a chronological series, this 
is the fourth of Pearce’s books set in a world where Fenris, wolf-like men, prey on 
young girls, and with each installment, the mythology behind the monsters grows 
increasingly complex and fascinating. Striking a balance between the bloody ac-

the creepy Fenris show up) and emotionally resonant—the search for a lost child-

offstage activities will likely keep fans invested enough in this world to see what

When Elephant comes across a little girl’s book, he’s curious, so he opens it up and 
starts sniffing. The print isn’t affixed very well to the page, though, and the letters 
shoot right up his trunk. Elephant then sneezes, but that turns “Once upon a time 
there was” into a mess of gibberish. None of Elephant’s animal friends are much help 
in getting things back in order, so Elephant sucks the letters back up. The book’s 
owner Gracie saves the day: when she finds that her missing book is now blank, she 
pulls and tickles the letters right back out and shows Elephant how to craft them 
back into a story. Unassuming and straightforward, this is a whimsical introduc-

literacies (although it will likely take either an old hat at recognizing words or a 
grownup’s direction to notice that the alligator who just wants to eat the letters up 
has rearranged them to say “chew” or that the juggling seal has jumbled them into 
“spin”). The messy line-and-wash illustrations enhance the playfulness with their 
relaxed, scribbly ink outlines and muddy watercolors in muted hues that often exceed 
their boundaries. Elephant’s horrified expressions as the other creatures nonchalantly

After a massive dust storm, old man Issa—renowned as the most skilled guide in 
the African desert—discovers a baby girl in a basket carried by a camel that was 
separated from the rest of its party. Issa takes the child in, names her Mariama, and 
teaches her to know the desert as intimately as he does. As Issa ages, he goes blind, 
and Mariama learns to become his eyes as the pair leads strangers across the barren 
landscape. When a group of young men come through one afternoon, they scoff 
at the idea of a blind guide and set off through the mountains on their own—only 
to be caught in a storm that Issa and Mariama show up just in time to save them

in fact Mariama’s brother and that she is the daughter of the king of Sana. Inspired 
by stories of a famous blind guide of Timbuktu, this tale is rendered in sparse and

strictly folklore, fans of the genre will appreciate the personable but wise narration 
and final plot twist. The mixed-media illustrations—some full-page panels, others 
as small insets, still others acting as backdrop for the text—communicate the harsh 
beauty of the desert with their soft and painterly outlines, vast and empty expanses, 
and earthy palette. The book’s picture-book format may mean it requires a little 
hand-selling to readers, but those who explore its pages will be rewarded with a

Half of New Pacifica, the terraformed island chain that is the only remaining hab-
itable place after war “cracked open the Earth,” is now in the throes of a violent 
revolution. The citizens of Galatea overthrew the ruling “aristos,” using a drug to 
artificially reduce their mental capacities, and then imprisoned and tortured them. 
Persis Blake, a socialite and best friend to the queen in the neighboring island of 
Albion, has been conducting secret missions as the Wild Poppy, rescuing Galatean 
aristos while figuring out a way to keep the revolution from her kingdom’s shores. 
Her mission—and her heart—is compromised when Justen Helo, a handsome 
revolutionary and the inventor of the Galatean reduction drug, seeks asylum in 
the royal court. Complex in both plotting and themes, this science fiction revision 
of The Scarlet Pimpernel offers political intrigue, narrow escapes, and forbidden 
romance but ultimately suffers from an uneven pace and a confused message. A 
repetitive emphasis on Persis’ and Justen’s internal conflicts only ends up making 
their concerns seem tedious, while paragraphs of exposition explain the world but 
fail to establish atmosphere. Matters of class and gender are used more for window

pressures of the adult world, so readers might still appreciate this addition to the

Eleven-year-old twins Nick and Tesla have been foisted on their uncle Newt while 
their parents are supposedly in Uzbekistan on a government agricultural project, but 
considering that the siblings love science and Uncle Newt is an inventor, that’s not 
a bad deal. And in fact, it leads to adventure: when Tesla’s keepsake pendant from 
her mother goes airborne with a bottle rocket into the yard of a spooky house in the 
neighborhood, the siblings and a couple of local kids wind up saving a kidnapped 
girl and revealing the identity of her captors. The mystery story itself is a fairly 
bare-bones affair, but it’s laced with humor to add dimension to the ensemble cast. 
The appeal of this title (first in a projected series) lies in the inclusion of homemade 
gadgetry the kids use in their detective activities and the instructions for readers 
to build their own replicas. Taking several science fair staples, such as Mentos and 
diet cola gas propulsion and a basic nail, wire, and battery magnet, and making 
them a vital part of the crime story should attract some mystery/science crossover 
readers, and the introduction of genuine doubt about the twins’ parents’ actual 
job generates enough intrigue to draw audiences back for another volume. Science 
teachers may be less than impressed by the lack of rigorous information on the 
science behind the inventions, but there’s no law that says middle-grade science 
must remain within the confines of a classroom lab. Doesn’t a midnight bike ride 
with a “semi-invisible nighttime van tracker” sound cool?  EB

In this standalone companion to her Circle of Magic series, Pierce chronicles the 
beginning of the war between the small mountain country of Gyonxe and the 
colonizing Yanjing, as referenced in The Will of the Empress (BCCB 1/06) and 
Melting Stones. Sixteen-year-old Briar, a renowned plant mage, and his mentor, the 
irascible Rosethorn, are joined by their twelve-year-old charge, Evvy, a spunky but 
powerful stone mage, as they journey to visit the famed gardens of the emperor 
of Yanjing. Once there, they realize the rumors of the emperor’s cruelty don’t do 
justice to the true ruthlessness of the man himself. After freeing one of his prison-
ers and tricking his guard, the three magicians flee the palace and travel to warn 
their friend, the God-King of Gyonxe, of the emperor’s plans to invade the God-
King’s mountainous homeland. Despite the constant threats to the trio’s safety, 
the initial pace here is actually quite languid, allowing readers—particularly those 
unfamiliar with the other books in the series—to become immersed in the world 
and the various rules and religions that govern it. Evvy’s capture and interrogation

by the emperor’s troops amp up the tension considerably and dramatically alter the 
emotional dynamic among the friends; suddenly, these three peace-loving magic 
wielders are consumed with vengeance and must balance their own desire for 
revenge with the responsibilities that their magic, and by extension the gods they 
believe in, force upon them. Indeed, faith and compassion are major themes here, 
set against a compelling war story that manages to capture the violence without 
glorifying it. Both familiar fans and readers just approaching Pierce’s canon will 
find this a satisfying, thought-provoking read.  KQG

Every year around Christmastime in Nickel Bay, a mysterious philanthropist 
dubbed “Nickel Bay Nick” leaves forty-five $100 bills around town over the course 
of twelve days. This year, though, Nickel Bay Nick has failed to show up, so the 
whole town’s depressed, and fifth-grader Sam is concerned that the lackluster 
economy will bring down his dad’s bakery. When Sam—who’s always been a bit 
of a troublemaker—accidentally destroys an elderly neighbor’s Christmas decora-
tions, he’s pushed into helping Mr. Wells around the house . . . only to discover 
that Mr. Wells is, in fact, Nickel Bay Nick. Sam’s rigorous training under the eyes 
of Mr. Wells’ friend Dr. Sakata prepares him to be the one to drop the money 
in the twelve days post-Christmas with ninja-like stealth—until Sam breaks Mr. 
Wells’ trust and leaves one of the bills for his father. Sam is realistically portrayed 
as a good guy who’s made a lot of serious mistakes, mostly from falling in with a 
couple of eighth-grader hooligans, and the facts that he has an absent mother and 
a transplanted heart are effectively woven into the text without becoming contriv-
ances. However, the treatment of Sam’s delinquency—and the implicit lesson to 
dump “bad eggs”—gives the book a preachy tone overall, and the ending tips toward 
the maudlin and unbelievably tidy in its gasp-inducing reveals. Still, Sam’s antics 
as he preps for his espionage and plants the Benjamins are good fun, and readers 
just beginning to negotiate their independence will likely recognize themselves 
in Sam’s rebellion. Fans of cunning capers, celebrate: there’s finally a sentimental 
holiday novel for you.  TA

Long-eared dog Daisy (of A Ball for Daisy) is back; this time her ball-chasing leads 
her to encounter—and subsequently chase—a squirrel. In her enthusiasm to catch 
the squirrel, Daisy leaves her ball behind and becomes lost in the woods. Her young 
owner, realizing that Daisy has gone missing, searches for her, and a mournful howl 
from Daisy eventually leads the girl to her lost dog. The bold ink, watercolor, and 
gouache illustrations, in rich, saturated colors, carry the spare story; scenes that 
fill the spreads alternate, very effectively, with scenes broken into a series of panels 
that show a progression of events. Daisy’s initial pursuit of the bright blue ball, 
for example, is broken down into four narrow panels, each extending across the 
width of the spread; the following spread is completely filled as Daisy, ball in her 
mouth and ears cocked forward, and the squirrel make eye contact, thus slowing 
the action to focus on the dramatic weight of that moment. The lack of text (“Go 
get it, Daisy!,” calls for “Daisy!,” and Daisy’s desperate howl are the only words in 
the book), may make this a bit challenging to share with larger groups, but small 
groups and lap-sitters will enjoy figuring out the action from the pictures and nar-
rating the events themselves. Young pet owners and animal lovers will especially

whale’s food leads to an interesting collaboration (motion from the whale’s flippers 
and tail makes the bioluminescent plankton glow) that gains a theme when the whale 
realizes that most marine life never gets to see the beauty of a starry night sky; the

The spirited and slightly goofy dialogue (most of the text is in speech bubbles) adds 
zing to a fairly familiar plot of a creativity breakthrough, and kids will particularly 
appreciate the breezy treatment of the whale and plankton’s relationship (“Please 
go away before I eat you,” says the piqued whale). The watercolor and pencil art 
makes excellent use of the spreads’ wide horizontality; while the art projects and, 
indeed, the underwater world are on the literal side for such an artistic-themed 
story, there’s a murky charm to life in the briny deep. The story is amusing, but 
what’s particularly appealing here is the casual inclusion of a wide variety of ap-
proaches to art, making this an entertaining lead-in to art projects, especially those 
involving the natural world.  DS

Near the end of the nineteenth century, Reverend Daniel Jenkins began his ministry 
to the children of Charleston, South Carolina by offering shelter in his church to 
a handful of orphans. Charitable donations allowed him to house more boys in a 
larger facility, but to make the orphanage self-sustaining, Jenkins hit upon the idea 
to organize the boys into a band, with donated instruments and first-rate instructors. 
Eventually their jazzy style, infused with rhythms and dance steps from the Gullah 
culture many of the boys descended from, caught the attention of Theodore Roo-
sevelt, who invited the band to play at his inaugural parade. The group eventually 
went international, playing in London in the opening days of World War I. Though 
they were fortunate to get home themselves, the band shared a significant portion 
of their performance profits with other stranded Americans whose financial assets 
had been frozen while they were overseas. Rockwell’s retelling of the early years of 
the Jenkins Orphanage Band has been somewhat compressed, and the feel-good 
mood of the true rags (sartorial and musical)-to-riches tale depends on ignoring 
the fact that they were not an immediately beloved, overnight success. Bootman’s 
atmospheric paintings, with individuated faces, almost photographic faces, convey 
a sense of the excitement that this new style of pop music caused, particularly in 
the white audiences who embraced it. An author’s note and brief bibliography are 
included, but google the Fox Movietone Newsreel film and audio performance

it turns out that Matthew disappeared days before their expected arrival. After a

Along the way Mila uses her gift for piecing together overlooked details to uncover 
Matthew’s secrets, hoping to find any clue to his whereabouts, but she learns more 
about her father and herself than anyone else. Equal parts mystery, family drama, 
and coming-of-age story, this captivating narrative weaves elements of a literal road-

tone, and it creates solid parallels between Mila’s actual and psychological journeys, 
deftly mixing descriptions of what she sees and people she meets with the jumble of 
emotions that color her experiences. Rosoff masterfully captures the perspective of 
a twelve-year-old girl who’s teetering between innocence and knowing too much, 
and gives her a voice to match. Despite her seemingly preternatural gift of insight, 
Mila emerges as a quintessential budding adolescent, wanting to be both protected

Elise has been an outcast since fourth grade, but she is determined that tenth grade 
will be different. Approaching cool like a research project, she learns about all of 
the music and movies she is supposed to like and how she is supposed to dress, 
but she forgets the most important thing: trying too hard to be cool is not cool. 
When things don’t work out, she contemplates suicide (and when Elise contem-
plates something, she explores all of the angles), and even makes a half-hearted 
attempt that results in her being more outcast than ever. Things finally change 
when she happens upon an after-hours club and learns to DJ, which makes her 
feel important and even gets her a boyfriend. Eventually, though, she learns even 
here that the problem is what it’s always been: that she’s precocious and the world 
rewards ordinary. Elise’s penetrating reflections on all of the facets of any situation 
in which she finds herself are the real draw here; being overly book-smart, she is 
appealingly snarky while questioning every social interaction and interrogating 
the effectiveness of her responses, mostly because they don’t work out the way she 
imagines they should. Since she’s firmly implanted in the high school scene, where 
being extraordinarily gifted at many things is seen as a disability, readers who fight 
their own battles with an intellect that outruns their social ease will find themselves 
relating to Elise’s wry observations about how hard it is to make even the simplest 
of relationships work. Elise’s path toward self-acceptance is bumpy enough to be 
credible and poignant enough to be genuinely moving, giving even the most socially 
awkward readers hope that their tribe is out there.  KC

Tink is an adorable Siamese cat with “a brain the size of a frozen pea,” given to nap-
ping in odd positions and eating things he shouldn’t (pool noodles, rubber bands, 
etc.). When his family brings home a kitten friend for him, there is a brief period 
of adjustment before the two felines become fast friends. As indoor cat Tink ages, 
he continues to be fascinated by the outdoors, and one day he manages to slip out 
unnoticed. While he initially enjoys his time outside, he soon becomes lost and 
ends up hanging out in another family’s garage until two girls recognize him from 
some “lost cat” posters and Tink is happily reunited with his family. This is more 
an affectionate ode to a beloved (if not too bright) pet than a straightforward story, 
but cat-loving kids will not mind a whit. Schachner’s narrative is gently amusing and 
carefully constructed, with occasional alliteration giving the text an almost lyrical 
quality: “So his mother, who loved her boy to bits, had no choice but to take Tink 
to the kitty clinic, where they treated him with green gloves and a giant red pill.” 
Tink’s charm really shines in the pictures, delicately rendered in charcoal pencil, 
pan pastels, watercolor, and cut paper, and the Siamese kitty’s wide, sky-blue eyes 
stand out brilliantly against his chocolate and cream fur. His poses—lazily snooz-
ing on a chair; violently flailing in the grip of the vet; twitching his tail grumpily 
at the arrival of the new kitten—capture the essence of his personality and his 
felinity. Skippyjon Jones fans will also notice a similarity between that character’s 
appearance and the new kitten that joins Tink’s family. Pair this with Schachner’s

who destroy New York and bite the heads off of lions and elephants; then Arnold 
reveals his “secret” and frightens the whole gang away. Although monsters terrified 
of radiators that make glinking noises are a lot of silly fun, this story is a standard 
telling of a plot kids have likely heard before (even if they haven’t quite taken it to 
heart yet). The increasing goofiness of the monsters (the toe biter’s a big fanged 
purple guy who looks a bit like a boar on two legs, and the grozny buzzler’s a squat 
olive bird with wire-rimmed glasses and a fez) amp up the readaloud pleasure, but 
the ending’s reliance on distant details and sudden resolution causes it to fall flat. 
Schneider’s ink, watercolor, and colored pencil illustrations are distinctly outlined, 
which sometimes busies up the pages but also adds a cartoonish over-the-top-ness 
that matches the story’s tone, a tendency enhanced by the kid-friendly saturated 
palette and the use of blue outlines to show Arnold’s imagined worlds. The real

Young Hannah knows exactly how despotic older sisters can be. Her big sister, Dee 
Dee, insults her, grabs the extra muffin at snack times, makes Hannah’s favorite 
apron into a purse, butts her way into Hannah’s playdates, relegates Hannah to 
the less desirable roles during imaginative play, and takes her beloved Brown Bear. 
Hannah finally decides to run away, pausing for a snack (“I unlocked my suitcase 
and ate my birthday chocolate bar. I didn’t have to share it with Dee Dee. I licked 
my fingers”) and a little solo playtime until Dee Dee shows up at her bedroom door. 
Sisterly rapprochement occurs as it turns out that Dee Dee took Brown Bear not 
to be mean but to replace his missing button eye for Hannah; now, when Dee Dee 
initiates a dress-up session, Hannah firmly negotiates a promotion to the coveted 
roles of Duchess and Evil Queen, and the two sisters go off happily to play together. 
Schwartz hits all the right notes in this tale of sibling dynamics, with precise, realistic 
examples of the ways in which bigger kids try to diminish their younger sibs: “Dee 
Dee is my sister. She is five and a half inches taller than me. Dee Dee says those 
five and a half inches are where a person’s brains are.” Lively patterns and decora-
tive details (such as Hannah’s penguin-studded jumper) and clear, soft colors (with 
brighter accent tones) give Schwartz’s gouache and pen and ink illustrations a cozy, 
homey feel, while the dot-eyed, childlike figures match Hannah’s youthful narrative 
voice. Younger siblings will easily sympathize with Hannah while older ones may 
see themselves in a new light after hearing Hannah’s perspective; this might be 
particularly successful when read aloud by an older sibling to a younger one.  JH

This new volume in Scieszka’s Guys Read series takes readers to other worlds or 
other versions of this one, where characters are called upon to be heroes and make 
split-second decisions that sometimes affect not only their own lives but the fate 
of the entire planet. In several of the stories, the nature of the enemy is unclear; 
in others, the morality of the situation determines the moment of decision. Rick 
Riordan’s Percy Jackson is here, cracking jokes and saving the world as he does, 
and there is a guest appearance by Ray Bradbury with a reprint of “Frost and Fire,” 
originally published in 1946. Shaun Tan illustrates a completely unordinary but 
perfectly charming day in the life of a deep thinker. The rest of the stories feature 
familiar authors (both male and female) telling new tales with boy-friendly fea-
tures—silly-smart humor, preposterous violence, hyperbolic grossness, and eerie 
weirdness. These modes, though, most often adorn “what-if” scenarios: what would 
you do if discovered that you were on the wrong side of a fight? Would you release 
a tortured spirit even if it cost you money? How would you trick an army bent on 
destroying you? Would you climb into a silo full of decades of collected human 
waste in order to save your own skin? Questions like these have no doubt been 
coming up on playgrounds, in treehouses, and at campsite for years; in the capable 
hands of Kenneth Oppel, Rebecca Stead, Shannon Hale, Neal Shusterman and 
others, guys and girls alike will have their imagination fires thoroughly stoked.  KC

Veteran author and poet Singer turns here to the forty-three men who have held 
the office of POTUS, giving each a swift, often irreverent poetic treatment. Like 
presidents, the verses are a varied lot: John Quincy Adams has a rollicking limerick-
esque entry that notes “Folks found him a bother/ (as they did his father)”; Lincoln’s 
sparer stanza addresses his fame (“By stovepipe hat, beard, large size,/ he’s the one 
we recognize”); Nixon’s entry is one of Singer’s self-designed “reverso” poems, 
appropriate for setting his achievements against his ignominy. The poems often 
have the compactness of epitaphs but a more interesting complexity of meter and

Arlo and his grandfather have been living on their own since the car accident that 
killed Arlo’s parents, but the sixth-grader finds himself taking care of Poppo more 
than the other way around as Poppo’s memory gets worse and worse. After a stroke 
sends Poppo to the hospital, Arlo, wanting to avoid being sent to a shelter, runs 
away to Virginia to find his other remaining relative, his father’s mother. Though 
Ida Jones has been estranged from her grandson (his parents’ marriage caused a 
serious falling out) and there’s a bit of friction between the two, she readily accepts 
Arlo into her home. Arlo befriends Maywood, the daughter of a local bookstore 
owner, and adjusts to life in the small town, in spite of the fact that Ida’s slated to 
sell her home and move to a condo in Richmond. Just when she’s poised to change 
her mind and stay, an out-of-town buyer’s suspiciously interested in her home, 
and Arlo and Maywood are determined to find out why. There’s no pretension in 
this simple but deep story, and Arlo’s struggles in his relationships with both Ida 
and Poppo—and his attempts to get a sense of his family’s muddied history—are 
treated with both frankness and sweetness. A playful air of mystery hangs over the 
second half of the novel, and there are even tinges of a good ghost story as Arlo 
and Maywood try to scare off the prospective buyer. Art history buffs will espe-
cially appreciate the fact that the final reveal involves a long-lost painting, but the 
carefully detailed development of a boy learning how to deal with being caught 
in-between will appeal to a wide range of readers. An author’s note including the 
history of an African-American artist whose life inspired the lost-painting portion 
of the plot is included.  TA

“When you will soon be a ghost, sometimes you see people before they are ghosts.

panther teen, and the ghost of Naomi’s young sister—who froze to death along the

walk—Isaac sets out to rescue Naomi from the soldiers who are using her as slave 
labor and reunite her with her family. Tingle’s prose is terse, urgently propelling the 
story along and providing a minimalist aesthetic that evokes storytelling techniques 
and renders accessible a tragic piece of history, a feat that’s also accomplished by 
brief chapters and a thrilling caper overlaying the historical information. Isaac’s 
insistent reminders to the reader that he will soon die make his death at the fangs 
of a wolf less of a shock and more of a device that allows Tingle to merge spiritual 
and physical worlds, while the infusion of Choctaw beliefs provides an interesting 
and important perspective. Some readers will likely notice the lack of source notes 
or background information save for a brief acknowledgement section and some 
discussion questions, but this slim volume—the start of a proposed trilogy, a fact 
made obvious by the introduction of a new character after the exploit’s resolu-
tion—would be useful in the classroom as an addition to studies of Indian removal 
and as a recommendation for reluctant readers who like their history tinged with 
the otherworldly.  TA

“She’s self-centered, her kid needs foster care, and her own family won’t have 
anything to do with her.” No, she’s not the mother in a YA novel, but one of the 
dolphins being studied in this captivating new outing in the venerable Scientists in 
the Field series. Author Turner joins Janet Mann and her colleagues on the west coast 
of Australia, where they’ve been studying this regional population of dolphins since 
the 1980s. Four decades of experience means the researchers know the dolphins’ 
personalities and their histories, so there’s an irresistible touch of dolphin soap opera 
to the book. There’s no shortage of fascinating science in the breezy and engaging 
narrative, though, as the team explores these dolphins’ innovative use of tools (raking 
the sea floor with sponges to chase hidden fish out) and how this knowledge seems 
to be transmitted (from mother to child, but female dolphins pick up the practice 
more often than male). The social dynamics of dolphin life and the evolutionary 
advantages and disadvantages of intelligence (notable in comparing the dolphins 
to their local predator the tiger shark) are also examined. While being deliberately 
anti-mythical about dolphins (“Dolphins aren’t noble elves in wetsuits”), the book 
conveys the wonder of learning more about the intricacy of another species, and 
readers will be won over by both the dolphins and the science. Photographs are 
sometimes hampered by the glassy waters that overlay their subjects, but they’re 
lively and plentiful, with informative captions. Don’t miss the end matter, which 
includes a tidbit about a pregnancy-detecting dolphin, an update on the doings of 
both human and animal dramatis personae, and encouragement to read not only 
the books and websites mentioned but also to explore peer-reviewed science articles; 
an index is also included.  DS

and only a short time after that when Mercy hears her mother softly crooning a

there’s an encroaching fog that makes everything simply vanish—and the Minister, 
an animal-like machine that preaches the Holy Word, has no answers, so Mercy 
decides to confront her mother, or whoever is inhabiting her mother now. What

Sadie is always willing to help out her family with whatever they need. They need 
a lot, though—her father is a reclusive hoarder who refuses to get help, her sister, 
Carla, is a substance-abusing single mom, and her mother works multiple jobs to 
keep them in their home. When Carla wants to party one night, Sadie lies to their 
mother and goes with her, only to find herself busted for drug trafficking when two 
guys trick her sister into making a delivery to an undercover cop. Since it would be 
Carla’s third offense, Sadie takes the fall thinking that she won’t have to do time, 
but a strict judge sentences her to six months in juvenile detention. There she 
runs afoul of the usual thugs and crazies before she settles into a keep-your-head-
down existence that enables her to survive her first three months, which is where 
the story ends. The book presents Sadie’s sacrifice as the noble, right thing to do, 
as it enables Carla to get her act together so she can be a better mom, and while 
Sadie has to lie consistently to keep the real story from surfacing, she maintains her 
wholesome good-girl personality through her ordeal. The suggestion that even a 
bad rap and a stint in juvie don’t have to change who you are is an interesting one, 
and the psychology of enabling is certainly credible. The notion that her sentence 
won’t damage Sadie’s chances for a future, including a college scholarship, doesn’t 
ring true, though, especially since she will have to maintain the lie that she was in 
fact guilty of selling drugs. The point that not guilty doesn’t mean innocent—she 
did, after all, make a series of bad decisions in going with her sister to the party—is 
subtly made, and readers may detect it through the overt story of Sadie as a strong 
and caring heroine making the best of a bad situation.  KC

Growing up in the tropical paradise of the Ghost Keys, a (fictional) chain of islands 
near the Bermuda Triangle, should be, well, paradise, but for twelve-year-old Rain 
Cacique, it feels more like a life sentence that dooms her to a future of bending 
over backwards for ungrateful tourists and never seeing what the rest of the world 
might offer. Her beloved grandfather, ’Bastian, is the bright spot in her world, so 
when he passes away, Rain immediately attributes her newfound ability to see dead 
people (including the spirit of her grandfather as a young fighter pilot) to grief. 
Eventually, however, ’Bastian is able to convince her that he is really there, that 
she needs to help him put other spirits to rest, and that the golden armband he 
left her, the zemi, is actually one of the keys to the mysteries of the Ghost Islands. 
Narrated by a canine spirit that serves as one of the many guardians of the islands, 
this is a delightfully odd but entirely satisfying blend of family drama, ghost story, 
and unexpected fantasy. Despite the Ghost Keys’ fictional status, Weisman weaves 
in both the class and race issues (Rain’s family are clearly natives of the island and 
her best friend is African American) that plague Rain’s village, dependent as it is 
on tourism from wealthier folks, but the author never overburdens his plot with 
anything too preachy and instead focuses on the adventure. The action delivers in 
spades, culminating with Rain piloting an old World War II fighter plane through 
a hurricane along with the ghosts and the skeletal remains of several soldiers. Savvy 
kids will spot the allusions to The Tempest, and the concluding reveal that Rain has 
only found one of nine secret keys will have all readers booking a return trip to the 
Ghosts for the sequel.  KQG

Fourteen-year-old Shad Weaver is leading two secret lives: in the late night hours, he’s 
participating in the meetings and “pranks” of the Ku Klux Klan; in the early morning 
hours, the boy is trading chores for reading lessons in the home of a Richmond Civil 
War widow, Miss Elizabeth, who also supports the cause of education for colored 
children. These two worlds collide when the Klan abducts, torments, and murders 
George Nelson, the white “carpetbagger” Yankee who was to run the new freed-
men’s school—but not before the victim recognizes and names “the Weaver boy” 
as one of his murderers. Yes, Shad was present at the murder, but it’s his firebrand 
older brother, Jeremiah, who is arrested for the crime. Shad keeps his mouth shut 
about his participation, even as he grieves the loss of the man who broke through 
his learning disability, and he tells the necessary lies to get his brother released 
from jail. Shad recognizes not only that Klan “pranking” has taken a mortal turn 
but that most of the Richmond men he knows are members of the brotherhood, 
watching his every move and planning to burn down Miss Elizabeth’s shed and the 
black schoolchildren in it. Westrick creates in Shad a character of extraordinary 
complexity—admiring and fearful of his brother, fiercely resentful of the Yankees

Edward Gibbon it’s not, but Williams’ slim, richly illustrated account of Roman 
history will probably do the trick for middle-grade students with an enthusiasm for 
ancient (or at least very, very early) history. She begins her story all the way back 
with creation myth, the tale of Prometheus, the Roman pantheon, and the legend 
of Romulus and Remus. Transitions from mythology to hazy history are clearly 
noted, but readers may not feel historical ground firmly under their feet until dates 
begin to appear with the six kings who follow Romulus. The Republic gets a few 
pages of attention, and then it’s briskly on to Empire, with a host of focus topics 
from ranks of citizenry, lifestyles of the patrician and plebeian, festivals, gladiators, 
and the army, until Diocletian divides the empire on the penultimate page, and the 
entire shebang collapses on the last. Shrinking this run of centuries into a picture-
book format is much of the charm—a bit like two-minute Shakespeare—and the 
addition of a dormouse tour guide, who has thus far avoided becoming another 
morsel in the Roman diet, is either a clever commentator or an outright annoyance, 
depending on the reader’s tolerance for whimsy. Children familiar with Williams’ 
customary format will feel right at home with the juxtaposition of light-hearted 
cartoon figures playing out their scenes against straightforward narration, and as 
always, it’s worth lingering over the illustrations to tease out both the nonsense and 
the historical detail scattered throughout. No source notes are included, but anyone 
who can find their way to the 937s can confirm and expand the information.  EB

“Dog people are clever, friendly, good-looking, funny, and overall fantastically 
wonderful. Cat people, on the other hand, are ugly, boring and smell bad.” So 
pronounces Otto, a puckish eleven year-old who, unsurprisingly, files himself in 
the former category. He desperately wants a dog of his own to teach tricks, take for 
walks, and train to bite his older sister, Lexi, a sworn cat-lover. When their mother 
proposes a friendly competition—whoever raises $500 in a month can get the pet 
of his or her choice—he must use all his wits to beat his smart and savvy sister. 
Charming and feckless, he is long on ideas but short on follow-through, creating a 
handful of money-raising schemes while juggling school and soccer, failing hilari-
ously at all of them. This fast-paced and funny novel presents a protagonist in the 
tradition of Tom Sawyer, a smug but winning preteen boy generally beloved by his 
peers though regarded with suspicion and perhaps a hint of distaste by adults. The 
relatable and redemptive Otto and his misadventures will fare especially well with 
those looking for a character with a smart mouth and big heart.  AA

With email and texting enabling instant long-distance communication, future col-

bring the mini-fridge and who will bring the microwave. Their exchanges begin 
at the end of June, sixty-five days before they meet—days they’re both counting, 
but for different reasons. Jersey girl Elizabeth wants to escape the condo she shares 
with her increasingly absent mother, who devotes her time to work and dating 
married men. Lauren, on the other hand, has a loving—and large—family, with 
five significantly younger siblings requiring much of her time and attention in their 
crowded San Francisco home. Before they make their separate ways to UC Berkeley, 
both girls will learn to navigate the many relationships put in flux by such major life 
transitions, trying to form new bonds with old friends, struggling to separate from 
parents, and exploring romantic love and all its trappings. Zarr and Altebrando take 
an empathetic, realistic, and relatable look at this complicated time in middle-class 
American adolescence and all the anxieties and elations that accompany it. With 
authentic and distinct voices relayed through a combination of emails and first-
person narratives, the authors create a modern and meaningful epistolary novel. 
Contemporary struggles to handle the constant availability of communication and 
information emerge alongside more timeless themes of self-discovery, family, and 
romance, creating a resonant story perfect for any teenager going to college—or 
simply struggling to make peace with herself and her world.  AA

Quite literally out on the street after she refuses to marry the lecher her wealthy 
uncle has chosen for her, seventeen-year-old Peggy Fitzroy puts her cleverness and 
natural people skills to good use as a spy in the court of King George I. Contacted 
by an old friend of her dead mother’s, Peggy secures a position as Princess Caroline’s 
lady-in-waiting with the condition that Peggy, like the now-deceased maid before 
her, relay any and all information about court alliances, rumors, and gossip back 
to Mr. Tinderflint, Mr. Peele, and Mrs. Abbott, an unlikely trio clearly interested 
in royal politics—but for what purposes, Peggy is unclear. Once at the palace, of 
course, Peggy finds herself in over her head and begins to suspect that her benefac-
tors aren’t nearly as interested in her well being as she was led to believe. YA has 
plenty of female spies snooping around a variety of historical eras, but Peggy still 
makes an admirable and likable addition to that crew, negotiating both the social 
theatrics of court life and the life-or-death action of espionage with a keen wit and 
stunning sense of fashion. Zettel is particularly deft at mining the facts surround-

romance, intrigue, and occasional catfighting among the ladies-in-waiting ensure 
that the history lesson is never obvious. This combination of willful heroine and

As the descendant of legendary voodoo queen Marie Laveau and with her parents 
and boyfriend major players in New Orleans voodoo society, seventeen-year-old 
Claire Kincaid should at least be interested in the magical art, but she can’t help 
thinking it’s all a bunch of nonsense. She may not believe in “doll babies” or hexes, 
but Claire takes threats to her family very seriously, and when a string of thefts 
and the appearance of a violent, mysterious man threaten all she holds dear, she 
puts her sleuthing skills and a few newly discovered psychic abilities to the test as 
she tries put a stop to a dark curse. Dressed up with a New Orleans setting and 
a bit of magic, this is basically a Nancy Drew mystery, and it follows a similarly 
predictable trajectory that has our heroine conveniently finding knowledgeable al-
lies in unfamiliar places, getting kidnapped just as she’s closing in on the bad guys, 
and then subsequently being rescued by pals but only after the villains reveal the 
details of their dastardly plot. The descriptions of the Garden District and Louisi-
ana backwaters liven things up a bit, but the exploration of voodoo never reaches 
beyond the superficial. The mention of curses and blood magic might be enough 
to attract fans of supernatural thrillers, however, and Nancy Drew in NOLA makes 
for a pretty easy booktalk.  KQG

Most librarians will be familiar with Readers Theatre as Poe defines it—as a staged 
reading of a text that uses limited action and minimal props—but it’s her collab-
orative reader-centered approach, involving young readers in every aspect of the 
production, that is likely to breathe life back into this library standby. Chapters 
One through Five focus on the value of a reader-centered approach, providing 
anecdotes from the author’s experiences with both young children and teens as 
participants, and offering use possibilities (using Readers Theatre to introduce an 
author during an author visit, for one, or allowing students studying World War II 
to select pieces to perform in class) and tips for setting the stage and prepping the 
group. The second part of the book is more nuts and bolts, providing a thorough 
how-to guide for adapting a script from literature, complete with a plethora of 
examples, and offering a timeline for meetings and the divvying up of tasks. A final 
section lists over a hundred books suited for Readers Theatre adaptation, grouped 
by age appropriateness. Practical and to the point, this would obviously make a 
valuable resource for any practitioner looking to start a Readers Theatre project, 
while the kid-centered approach is likely be refreshing for librarians who too often 
find themselves writer, director, prop hand, and one-person clean-up crew.  KQG

Over the River and 
Through the Wood
An Anthology of 
Nineteenth-Century 
American Children’s Poetry
��������������������������
����������������
“I have been wanting a book like this for as 
long as I can remember. It is a tremendous 
accomplishment; one of those rare books 
that is an absolute ‘must own’ for anyone 
with an interest in children’s poetry, and 
even poetry in general.”
—Kenn Nesbitt, Children’s Poet Laureate
“This delightful anthology, gathered from 
the golden age of children’s verse, off ers a 
wealth of poems for (and often by) children. 
The book is divided into sections according 
to theme, and that is a brilliant idea because 
children’s poetry of the latter 19th century 
was not often grim and admonitory, and 
the poems of any section tend to be full of 
amiable interplay. Speaking for myself, as I 
read these poems and enjoy their variety, I 
feel as if I were present at a warm-hearted 
gathering of family and friends.”
—Richard  Wilbur, U.S. Poet Laureate, 
1987–1988
“It is said that the nineteenth century 
invented children‘s literature and in doing 
so reinvented childhood. This magical and 
very delicious book sets us down right in 
the middle of that rich act of imagination. 
An amazing act of (deft, almost invisible) 
scholarly recuperation.”
—Robert Hass, U.S. Poet Laureate, 1995–
1997
“Kilcup and Sorby have done us a huge 
service here in bringing this collection of 
superb poetry for children by nineteenth-
century poets under a single cover. It’s a 
major contribution to literary studies, of 
course. But more so, it’s a book that every 
child—whatever his or her age—will enjoy.”
—Jay Parini, award-winning poet, fi ction 
writer, critic, and editor
